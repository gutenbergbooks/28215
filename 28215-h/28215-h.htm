<h2><i>CHAPTER ONE</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Spencer Chambers</span>
frowned at the spacegram
on the desk before him.
John Moore Mallory. That was
the man who had caused so much
trouble in the Jovian elections.
The troublemaker who had
shouted for an investigation of
Interplanetary Power. The man
who had said that Spencer Chambers
and Interplanetary Power
were waging economic war against
the people of the Solar System.</p>

<p>Chambers smiled. With long,
well-kept fingers, he rubbed his
iron-gray mustache.</p>

<p>John Moore Mallory was right;
for that reason, he was a dangerous
man. Prison was the place
for him, but probably a prison
outside the Jovian confederacy.
Perhaps one of the prison ships
that plied to the edge of the System,
clear to the orbit of Pluto.
Or would the prison on Mercury
be better?</p>

<p>Spencer Chambers leaned back
in his chair and matched his fingertips,
staring at them, frowning
again.</p>

<p>Mercury was a hard place. A
man's life wasn't worth much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
there. Working in the power
plants, where the Sun poured
out its flaming blast of heat, and
radiations sucked the energy
from one's body, in six months,
a year at most, any man was finished.</p>

<p>Chambers shook his head. Not
Mercury. He had nothing against
Mallory. He had never met the
man but he rather liked him.
Mallory was just a man fighting
for a principle, the same as Chambers
was doing.</p>

<p>He was sorry that it had been
necessary to put Mallory in prison.
If the man only had listened
to reason, had accepted the proposals
that had been made, or
just had dropped out of sight
until the Jovian elections were
over ... or at least had moderated
his charges. But when he
had attempted to reveal the offers,
which he termed bribery,
something had to be done.</p>

<p>Ludwig Stutsman had handled
that part of it. Brilliant fellow,
this Stutsman, but as mean a human
as ever walked on two legs.
A man utterly without mercy,
entirely without principle. A man
who would stoop to any depth.
But a useful man, a good one to
have around to do the dirty work.
And dirty work sometimes was
necessary.</p>

<p>Chambers picked up the spacegram
again and studied it. Stutsman,
out on Callisto now, had
sent it. He was doing a good job
out there. The Jovian confederacy,
less than one Earth year
under Interplanetary domination,
was still half rebellious, still angry
at being forced to turn over
its government to the hand-picked
officials of Chambers' company.
An iron heel was needed
and Stutsman was that iron heel.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">So</span> the people on the Jovian satellites
wanted the release of
John Moore Mallory. "They're
getting ugly," the spacegram said.
It had been a mistake to confine
Mallory to Callisto. Stutsman
should have thought of that.</p>

<p>Chambers would instruct Stutsman
to remove Mallory from the
Callisto prison, place him on one
of the prison ships. Give instructions
to the captain to make
things comfortable for him. When
this furor had blown over, after
things had quieted down in the
Jovian confederacy, it might be
possible to release Mallory. After
all, the man wasn't really guilty
of any crime. It was a shame that
he should be imprisoned when
racketeering rats like Scorio went
scot-free right here in New York.</p>

<p>A buzzer purred softly and
Chambers reached out to press a
stud.</p>

<p>"Dr. Craven to see you," his
secretary said. "You asked to see
him, Mr. Chambers."</p>

<p>"All right," said Chambers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
"Send him right in."</p>

<p>He clicked the stud again,
picked up his pen, wrote out a
spacegram to Stutsman, and
signed it.</p>

<p>Dr. Herbert Craven stood just
inside the door, his black suit
wrinkled and untidy, his sparse
sandy hair standing on end.</p>

<p>"You sent for me," he said
sourly.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Doctor," invited
Chambers.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Craven</span> sat down. He peered
at Chambers through thick-lensed
glasses.</p>

<p>"I haven't much time," he declared
acidly.</p>

<p>"Cigar?" Chambers offered.</p>

<p>"Never smoke."</p>

<p>"A drink, then?"</p>

<p>"You know I don't drink,"
snapped Craven.</p>

<p>"Doctor," said Chambers,
"you're the least sociable man
I've ever known. What do you
do to enjoy yourself?"</p>

<p>"I work," said Craven. "I find
it interesting."</p>

<p>"You must. You even begrudge
the time it takes to talk with me."</p>

<p>"I won't deny it. What do you
want this time?"</p>

<p>Chambers swung about to face
him squarely across the desk.
There was a cold look in the
financier's gray eyes and his lips
were grim.</p>

<p>"Craven," he said, "I don't
trust you. I've never trusted you.
Probably that's no news to you."</p>

<p>"You don't trust anyone,"
countered Craven. "You're watching
everybody all the time."</p>

<p>"You sold me a gadget I didn't
need five years ago," said Chambers.
"You outfoxed me and I
don't hold it against you. In fact,
it almost made me admire you.
Because of that I put you under
a contract, one that you and all
the lawyers in hell can't break,
because someday you'll find
something valuable, and when
you do, I want it. A million a
year is a high price to pay to
protect myself against you, but
I think it's worth it. If I didn't
think so, I'd have turned you
over to Stutsman long ago. Stutsman
knows how to handle men
like you."</p>

<p>"You mean," said Craven,
"that you've found I'm working
on something I haven't reported
to you."</p>

<p>"That's exactly it."</p>

<p>"You'll get a report when I
have something to report. Not
before."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Chambers.
"I just wanted you to know."</p>

<p>Craven got to his feet slowly.
"These talks with you are so refreshing,"
he remarked.</p>

<p>"We'll have to have them oftener,"
said Chambers.</p>

<p>Craven banged the door as he
went out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Chambers stared after him. A
queer man, the most astute scientific
mind anywhere, but not
a man to be trusted.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> president of Interplanetary
Power rose from his chair
and walked to the window. Below
spread the roaring inferno of New
York, greatest city in the Solar
System, a strange place of queer
beauty and weighty materialism,
dreamlike in its super-skyscraper
construction, but utilitarian in its
purpose, for it was a port of many
planets.</p>

<p>The afternoon sunlight
slanted through the window, softening
the iron-gray hair of the
man who stood there. His shoulders
almost blocked the window,
for he had the body of a fighting
man, one, moreover, in good condition.
His short-clipped mustache
rode with an air of dignity
above his thin, rugged mouth.</p>

<p>His eyes looked out on the
city, but did not see it. Through
his brain went the vision of a
dream that was coming true. His
dream spun its fragile net about
the planets of the Solar System,
about their moons, about every
single foot of planetary ground
where men had gone to build
and create a second homeland&mdash;the
mines of Mercury and the
farms of Venus, the pleasure-lands
of Mars and the mighty
domed cities on the moons of
Jupiter, the moons of Saturn
and the great, cold laboratories
of Pluto.</p>

<p>Power was the key, supplied
by the accumulators owned and
rented by Interplanetary Power.
A monopoly of power. Power that
Venus and Mercury had too
much of, must sell on the market,
and that the other planets and
satellites needed. Power to drive
huge spaceships across the void,
to turn the wheels of industry,
to heat the domes on colder
worlds. Power to make possible
the life and functioning of mankind
on hostile worlds.</p>

<p>In the great power plants of
Mercury and Venus, the accumulators
were charged and then
shipped out to those other worlds
where power was needed. Accumulators
were rented, never sold.
Because they belonged at all
times to Interplanetary Power,
they literally held the fate of all
the planets in their cells.</p>

<p>A few accumulators were manufactured
and sold by other
smaller companies, but they were
few and the price was high. Interplanetary
saw to that. When the
cry of monopoly was raised, Interplanetary
could point to these
other manufacturers as proof that
there was no restraint of trade.
Under the statute no monopoly
could be charged, but the cost of
manufacturing accumulators
alone was protection against serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
competition from anyone.</p>

<p>Upon a satisfactory, efficient
power-storage device rested the
success or failure of space travel
itself. That device and the power
it stored were for sale by Interplanetary ...
and, to all practical
purposes, by Interplanetary only.</p>

<p>Accordingly, year after year,
Interplanetary had tightened its
grip upon the Solar System. Mercury
was virtually owned by the
company. Mars and Venus were
little more than puppet states. And
now the government of the Jovian
confederacy was in the hands
of men who acknowledged Spencer
Chambers as their master. On
Earth the agents and the lobbyists
representing Interplanetary
swarmed in every capital, even in
the capital of the Central European
Federation, whose people
were dominated by an absolute
dictatorship. For even Central
Europe needed accumulators.</p>

<p>"Economic dictatorship," said
Spencer Chambers to himself.
"That's what John Moore Mallory
called it." Well, why not?
Such a dictatorship would insure
the best business brains at the
heads of the governments, would
give the Solar System a business
administration, would guard
against the mistakes of popular
government.</p>

<p>Democracies were based on a
false presumption&mdash;the theory
that all people were fit to rule.
It granted intelligence where
there was no intelligence. It presumed
ability where there was
not the slightest trace of any. It
gave the idiot the same political
standing as the wise man, the
crackpot the same political opportunity
as the man of well-grounded
common sense, the
weakling the same voice as the
strong man. It was government by
emotion rather than by judgment.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Spencer Chambers'</span> face
took on stern lines. There was
no softness left now. The late
afternoon sunlight painted angles
and threw shadows and created
highlights that made him look almost
like a granite mask on a
solid granite body.</p>

<p>There was no room for Mallory's
nonsense in a dynamic, expanding
civilization. No reason
to kill him&mdash;even he might have
value under certain circumstances,
and no really efficient executive
destroys value&mdash;but he
had to be out of the way where
his mob-rousing tongue could do
no damage. The damned fool!
What good would his idiotic
idealism do him on a prison
spaceship?</p>

<hr class="tb" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>CHAPTER TWO</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Russell Page</span> squinted
thoughtful eyes at the thing
he had created&mdash;a transparent
cloud, a visible, sharply outlined
cloud of <i>something</i>. It was visible
as a piece of glass is visible, as
a globe of water is visible. There
it lay, within his apparatus, a
thing that shouldn't be.</p>

<p>"I believe we have something
there, Harry," he said slowly.</p>

<p>Harry Wilson sucked at the
cigarette that drooped from the
corner of his mouth, blew twin
streams of smoke from his nostrils.
His eyes twitched nervously.</p>

<p>"Yeah," he said. "Anti-entropy."</p>

<p>"All of that," said Russell Page.
"Perhaps a whole lot more."</p>

<p>"It stops all energy change,"
said Wilson, "as if time stood
still and things remained exactly
as they were when time had
stopped."</p>

<p>"It's more than that," Page declared.
"It conserves not only
energy <i>in toto</i>, not only the energy
of the whole, but the energy
of the part. It is perfectly transparent,
yet it has refractive qualities.
It won't absorb light because
to do so would change its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
energy content. In that field,
whatever is hot stays hot, whatever
is cold can't gain heat."</p>

<p>He scraped his hand over a
week's growth of beard, considering.
From his pocket he took a
pipe and a leather pouch.
Thoughtfully he filled the pipe
and lit it.</p>

<p>It had started with his experiments
in Force Field 348, an experiment
to observe the effects
of heating a conductor in that
field. It had been impossible to
heat the conductor electrically,
for that would have upset the
field, changed it, twisted it into
something else. So he had used
a Bunsen burner.</p>

<p>Through half-closed eyes, he
still could see that slender strand
of imperm wire, how its silvery
length had turned to red under
the blue flame. Deep red at first
and then brighter until it flamed
in almost white-hot incandescence.
And all the while the humming
of the transformer as the
force field built up. The humming
of the transformer and the muted
roaring of the burner and the
glowing heat in the length of wire.</p>

<p>Something had happened then ...
an awesome something. A
weird wrench as if some greater
power, some greater law had
taken hold. A glove of force, invisible,
but somehow sensed, had
closed about the wire and flame.
Instantly the roaring of the burner
changed in tone; an odor of
gas spewed out of the vents at
its base. Something had cut off
the flow of flame in the brass
tube. Some force, <i>something</i> ...</p>

<p>The flame was a transparent
cloud. The blue and red of flame
and hot wire had changed, in the
whiplash of a second, to a refractive
but transparent cloud that
hung there within the apparatus.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> red color had vanished
from the wire as the blue had
vanished from the flame. The
wire was shining. It wasn't silvery;
it wasn't white. There was
no hint of color, just a refractive
blur that told him the wire was
there. Colorless reflection. <i>And
that meant perfect reflection!</i>
The most perfect reflectors reflect
little more than 98 per cent of
the light incident and the absorption
of the two per cent colors
those reflectors as copper or gold
or chromium. But the imperm
wire within that force field that
had been flame a moment before,
was reflecting <i>all</i> light.</p>

<p>He had cut the wire with a pair
of shears and it had still hung,
unsupported, in the air, unchanging
within the shimmer that constituted
something no man had
ever seen before.</p>

<p>"You can't put energy in," said
Page, talking to himself, chewing
the bit of his pipe. "You can't
take energy out. It's still as hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
as it was at the moment the
change came. But it can't radiate
any of that heat. It can't radiate
any kind of energy."</p>

<p>Why, even the wire was reflective,
so that it couldn't absorb
energy and thus disturb the balance
that existed within that bit
of space. Not only energy itself
was preserved, but the very form
of energy.</p>

<p>But why? That was the question
that hammered at him.
Why? Before he could go ahead,
he had to know why.</p>

<p>Perhaps the verging of the
field toward Field 349? Somewhere
in between those two
fields of force, somewhere within
that almost non-existent borderline
which separated them, he
might find the secret.</p>

<p>Rising to his feet, he knocked
out his pipe.</p>

<p>"Harry," he announced, "we
have work to do."</p>

<p>Smoke drooled from Wilson's
nostrils.</p>

<p>"Yeah," he said.</p>

<p>Page had a sudden urge to
lash out and hit the man. That
eternal drooling of smoke out of
his nostrils, that everlasting cigarette
dangling limply from one
corner of his mouth, the shifty
eyes, the dirty fingernails, got on
his nerves.</p>

<p>But Wilson was a mechanical
genius. His hands were clever
despite the dirty nails. They
could fashion pinhead cameras
and three-gram electroscopes or
balances capable of measuring
the pressure of electronic impacts.
As a laboratory assistant he was
unbeatable. If only he wouldn't
answer every statement or question
with that nerve-racking
'yeah'!</p>

<p>Page stopped in front of a
smaller room, enclosed by heavy
quartz. Inside that room was the
great bank of mercury-vapor rectifiers.
From them lashed a blue-green
glare that splashed against
his face and shoulders, painting
him in angry, garish color. The
glass guarded him from the terrific
blast of ultra-violet light that
flared from the pool of shimmering
molten metal, a terrible emanation
that would have flayed a
man's skin from his body within
the space of seconds.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> scientist squinted his eyes
against the glare. There was
something in it that caught him
with a deadly fascination. The
personification of power&mdash;the
incredibly intense spot of incandescent
vapor, the tiny sphere
of blue-green fire, the spinning
surge of that shining pool, the
intense glare of ionization.</p>

<p>Power ... the breath of modern
mankind, the pulse of progress.</p>

<p>In an adjacent room were the
accumulators. Not Interplanetary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
accumulators, which he would
have had to rent, but ones he
had bought from a small manufacturer
who turned out only ten
or fifteen thousand a year ...
not enough to bother Interplanetary.</p>

<p>Gregory Manning had made
it possible for him to buy those
accumulators. Manning had made
many things possible in this little
laboratory hidden deep within
the heart of the Sierras, many
miles from any other habitation.</p>

<p>Manning's grandfather, Jackson
Manning, had first generated
the curvature field and overcome
gravity, had left his grandson a
fortune that approached the five-billion
mark. But that had not
been all. From his famous ancestor,
Manning had inherited a
keen, sharp, scientific mind. From
his mother's father, Anthony Barret,
he had gained an astute
business sense. But unlike his maternal
grandfather, he had not
turned his attention entirely to
business. Old Man Barret had virtually
ruled Wall Street for almost
a generation, had become a
financial myth linked with keen
business sense, with an uncanny
ability to handle men and money.
But his grandson, Gregory Manning,
had become known to the
world in a different way. For
while he had inherited scientific
ability from one side of the family,
financial sense from the other,
he likewise had inherited from
some other ancestor&mdash;perhaps remote
and unknown&mdash;a wanderlust
that had taken him to the farthest
outposts of the Solar
System.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> was Gregory Manning who
had financed and headed the
rescue expedition which took the
first Pluto flight off that dark icebox
of a world when the exploration
ship had crashed. It was he
who had piloted home the winning
ship in the Jupiter derby,
sending his bulleting craft screaming
around the mighty planet in a
time which set a Solar record. It
was Gregory Manning who had
entered the Venusian swamps
and brought back, alive, the mystery
lizard that had been reported
there. And he was the one who
had flown the serum to Mercury
when the lives of ten thousand
men depended upon the thrumming
engines that drove the shining
ship inward toward the Sun.</p>

<p>Russell Page had known him
since college days. They had
worked out their experiments together
in the school laboratories,
had spent long hours arguing and
wondering ... debating scientific
theories. Both had loved the same
girl, both had lost her, and together
they had been bitter over
it ... drowning their bitterness in
a three-day drunk that made campus
history.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>After graduation Gregory Manning
had gone on to world fame,
had roamed over the face of
every planet except Jupiter and
Saturn, had visited every inhabited
moon, had climbed Lunar
mountains, penetrated Venusian
swamps, crossed Martian deserts,
driven by a need to see and experience
that would not let him
rest. Russell Page had sunk into
obscurity, had buried himself in
scientific research, coming more
and more to aim his effort at the
discovery of a new source of
power ... power that would be
cheap, that would destroy the
threat of Interplanetary dictatorship.</p>

<p>Page turned away from the
rectifier room.</p>

<p>"Maybe I'll have something to
show Greg soon," he told himself.
"Maybe, after all these years...."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Forty</span> minutes after Page put
through the call to Chicago,
Gregory Manning arrived. The
scientist, watching for him from
the tiny lawn that surrounded the
combined home and laboratory,
saw his plane bullet into sight,
scream down toward the little
field and make a perfect landing.</p>

<p>Hurrying toward the plane as
Gregory stepped out of it, Russell
noted that his friend looked the
same as ever, though it had been
a year or more since he had seen
him. The thing that was discomfiting
about Greg was his apparently
enduring youthfulness.</p>

<p>He was clad in jodhpurs and
boots and an old tweed coat, with
a brilliant blue stock at his throat.
He waved a hand in greeting and
hurried forward. Russ heard the
grating of his boots across the
gravel of the walk.</p>

<p>Greg's face was bleak; it always
was. A clean, smooth face,
hard, with something stern about
the eyes.</p>

<p>His grip almost crushed Russ's
hand, but his tone was crisp. "You
sounded excited, Russ."</p>

<p>"I have a right to be," said the
scientist. "I think I have found
something at last."</p>

<p>"Atomic power?" asked Manning.
There was no flutter of excitement
in his voice, just a little
hardening of the lines about his
eyes, a little tensing of the muscles
in his cheeks.</p>

<p>Russ shook his head. "Not
atomic energy. If it's anything,
it's material energy, the secret of
the energy of matter."</p>

<p>They halted before two lawn
chairs.</p>

<p>"Let's sit down here," invited
Russ. "I can tell it to you out
here, show it to you afterward.
It isn't often I can be outdoors."</p>

<p>"It is a fine place," said Greg.
"I can smell the pines."</p>

<p>The laboratory perched on a
ledge of rugged rock, nearly 7,000
feet above sea level. Before them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the land swept down in jagged
ruggedness to a valley far below,
where a stream flashed in the
noonday sun. Beyond climbed
pine-clad slopes and far in the
distance gleamed shimmering
spires of snow-capped peaks.</p>

<p>From his leather jacket Russ
hauled forth his pipe and tobacco,
lighted up.</p>

<p>"It was this way," he said.
Leaning back comfortably he outlined
the first experiment. Manning
listened intently.</p>

<p>"Now comes the funny part,"
Russ added. "I had hopes before,
but I believe this is what put me
on the right track. I took a metal
rod, a welding rod, you know. I
pushed it into that solidified force
field, if that is what you'd call it ...
although that doesn't describe
it. The rod went in. Took a lot of
pushing, but it went in. And
though the field seemed entirely
transparent, you couldn't see the
rod, even after I had pushed
enough of it in so it should have
come out the other side. It was
as if it hadn't entered the sphere
of force at all. As if I were just
telescoping the rod and its density
were increasing as I pushed,
like pushing it back into itself,
but that, of course, wouldn't have
been possible."</p>

<p>He paused and puffed at his
pipe, his eyes fixed on the snowy
peaks far in the purple distance.
Manning waited.</p>

<p>"Finally the rod came out,"
Russ went on. "Mind you, it came
out, even after I would have
sworn, if I had relied alone upon
my eyes, that it hadn't entered
the sphere at all. <i>But it came out
ninety degrees removed from its
point of entry!</i>"</p>

<p>"Wait a second," said Manning.
"This doesn't check. Did you do
it more than once?"</p>

<p>"I did it a dozen times and the
results were the same each time.
But you haven't heard the half
of it. When I pulled that rod
out&mdash;yes, I could pull it out&mdash;it
was a good two inches shorter
than when I had pushed it in. I
couldn't believe that part of it. It
was even harder to believe than
that the rod should come out
ninety degrees from its point of
entry. I measured the rods after
that and made sure. Kept an accurate
record. Every single one of
them lost approximately two
inches by being shoved into the
sphere. Every single one of them
repeated the phenomenon of
curving within the sphere to come
out somewhere else than where
I had inserted them."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Any</span> explanation of it?"
asked Manning, and now
there was a cold chill of excitement
in his voice.</p>

<p>"Theories, no real explanations.
Remember that you can't
see the rod after you push it into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the sphere. It's just as if it isn't
there. Well, maybe it isn't. You
can't disturb anything within that
sphere or you'd change the sum
of potential-kinetic-pressure energies
within it. The sphere seems
dedicated to that one thing ... it
cannot change. If the rod struck
the imperm wire within the field,
it would press the wire down,
would use up energy, decrease the
potential energy. So the rod simply
had to miss it somehow. I believe
it <i>moved into some higher
plane of existence and went
around</i>. And in doing that it had
to turn so many corners, so many
fourth-dimensional corners, that
the length was used up. Or maybe
it was increased in density.
I'm not sure. Perhaps no one will
ever know."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me about
this sooner?" demanded Manning.
"I should have been out here
helping you. Maybe I wouldn't be
much good, but I might have
helped."</p>

<p>"You'll have your chance,"
Russ told him. "We're just starting.
I wanted to be sure I had
something before I troubled you.
I tried other things with that first
sphere. I found that metal pushed
through the sphere will conduct
an electrical current, which is
pretty definite proof that the metal
isn't within the sphere at all.
Glass can be forced through it
without breaking. Not flexible
glass, but rods of plain old brittle
glass. It turns without breaking,
and it also loses some of its
length. Water can be forced
through a tube inserted in the
sphere, but only when terrific
pressure is applied. What that
proves I can't even begin to
guess."</p>

<p>"You said you experimented on
the first sphere," said Manning.
"Have you made others?"</p>

<p>Russ rose from his chair.</p>

<p>"Come on in, Greg," he said,
and there was a grin on his face.
"I have something you'll have to
see to appreciate."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> apparatus was heavier
and larger than the first in
which Russ had created the
sphere of energy. Fed by a powerful
accumulator battery, five
power leads were aimed at it,
centered in the space between
four great copper blocks.</p>

<p>Russ's hand went out to the
switch that controlled the power.
Suddenly the power beams
flamed, changed from a dull glow
into an intense, almost intolerable
brilliance. A dull grumble of
power climbed up to a steady
wail.</p>

<p>The beams had changed color,
were bluish now, the typical color
of ionized air. They were just
power beams, meeting at a common
center, but somehow they
were queer, too, for though they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
were capable of slashing far out
into space, they were stopped
dead. Their might was pouring
into a common center and going
no farther. A splash of intensely
glowing light rested over them,
then began to rotate slowly as a
motor somewhere hummed softly,
cutting through the mad roar and
rumble of power that surged
through the laboratory.</p>

<p>The glowing light was spinning
more swiftly now. A rotating field
was being established. The power
beams began to wink, falling and
rising in intensity. The sphere
seemed to grow, almost filling the
space between the copper blocks.
It touched one and rebounded
slightly toward another. It extended,
increased slightly. A terrible
screaming ripped through
the room, drowning out the titanic
din as the spinning sphere
came in contact with the copper
blocks, as force and metal resulted
in weird friction.</p>

<p>With a shocking wrench the
beams went dead, the scream cut
off, the roar was gone. A terrifying
silence fell upon the room as
soon as the suddenly thunking
relays opened automatically.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> sphere was gone! In its
place was a tenuous refraction
that told where it had been. That
and a thin layer of perfectly reflective
copper ... colorless now,
but Manning knew it was copper,
for it represented the continuation
of the great copper blocks.</p>

<p>His mind felt as if it were racing
in neutral, getting nowhere.
Within that sphere was the total
energy that had been poured out
by five gigantic beams, turned on
full, for almost a minute's time.
Compressed energy! Energy
enough to blast these mountains
down to the primal rock were it
released instantly. Energy trapped
and held by virtue of some peculiarity
of that little borderline
between Force Fields 348 and
349.</p>

<p>Russ walked across the room
to a small electric truck with rubber
caterpillar treads, driven by a
bank of portable accumulators.
Skillfully the scientist maneuvered
it over to the other side of
the room, picked up a steel bar
four inches in diameter and five
feet long. Holding it by the handler's
magnetic crane, he fixed it
firmly in the armlike jaws on the
front of the machine, then moved
the machine into a position straddling
the sphere of force.</p>

<p>With smashing momentum the
iron jaws thrust downward, driving
the steel bar into the sphere.
There was a groaning crash as
the handler came to a halt, shuddering,
with only eight inches of
the bar buried in the sphere. The
stench of hot insulation filled the
room while the electric motor
throbbed, the rubber treads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
creaked, the machine groaned
and strained, but the bar would
go no farther.</p>

<p>Russ shut off the machine and
stood back.</p>

<p>"That gives you an idea," he
said grimly.</p>

<p>"The trick now," Greg said, "is
to break down the field."</p>

<p>Without a word, Russ reached
for the power controls. A sudden
roar of thunderous fury and the
beams leaped at the sphere ... but
this time the sphere did not materialize
again. Again the wrench
shuddered through the laboratory,
a wrench that seemed to
distort space and time.</p>

<p>Then, as abruptly as it had
come, it was gone. But when it
ended, something gigantic and incomprehensibly
powerful seemed
to rush soundlessly by ... something
that was felt and sensed. It
was like a great noiseless, breathless
wind in the dead of night
that rushed by them and through
them, all about them in space and
died slowly away.</p>

<p>But the vanished steel did not
reappear with the disappearance
of the sphere and the draining
away of power. Almost grotesquely
now, the handler stood poised
above the place where the sphere
had been and in its jaws it held
the bar. But the end of the bar,
the eight inches that had been
within the sphere, was gone. It
had been sliced off so sharply
that it left a highly reflective concave
mirror on the severed surface.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" demanded Manning.
"In that higher dimension?"</p>

<p>Russ shook his head. "You noticed
that rushing sensation?
That may have been the energy
of matter rushing into some other
space. It may be the key to the
energy of matter!"</p>

<p>Gregory Manning stared at the
bar. "I'm staying with you, Russ.
I'm seeing this thing through."</p>

<p>"I knew you would," said Russ.</p>

<p>Triumph flamed briefly in
Manning's eyes. "And when we
finish, we'll have something that
will break Interplanetary. We'll
smash their stranglehold on the
Solar System." He stopped and
looked at Page. "Lord, Russ," he
whispered, "do you realize what
we'll have?"</p>

<p>"I think I do, Greg," the scientist
answered soberly. "Material
energy engines. Power so cheap
that you won't be able to give it
away. More power than anybody
could ever need."</p>

<hr class="tb" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>CHAPTER THREE</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Russ</span> hunched over the keyboard
set in the control room
of the <i>Comet</i> and stared down
at the keys. The equation was set
and ready. All he had to do was
tap that key and they would
know, beyond all argument,
whether or not they had dipped
into the awful heart of material
energy; whether, finally, they
held in their grasp the key to the
release of energy that would give
the System power to spare.</p>

<p>His glance lifted from the keyboard,
looked out the observation
port. Through the inkiness of
space ran a faint blue thread, a
tiny line that stretched from the
ship and away until it was lost in
the darkness of the void.</p>

<p>One hundred thousand miles
away, that thread touched the
surface of a steel ball bearing ...
a speck in the immensity of space.</p>

<p>He thought about that little
beam of blue. It took power to do
that, power to hold a beam tight
and strong and steady through
the stress of one hundred thousand
miles. But it had to be that
far away ... and they had that
power. From the bowels of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
ship came the deep purr of it, the
angry, silky song of mighty engines
throttled down.</p>

<p>He heard Harry Wilson shuffling
impatiently behind him,
smelled the acrid smoke that
floated from the tip of Wilson's
cigarette.</p>

<p>"Might as well punch that key,
Russ," said Manning's cool voice.
"We have to find out sooner or
later."</p>

<p>Russ's finger hovered over the
key, steadied and held. When he
punched that key, if everything
worked right, the energy in the
tiny ball bearing would be released
instantaneously. The energy
of a piece of steel, weighing
less than an ounce. Over that
tight beam of blue would flash
the impulse of destruction....</p>

<p>His fingers plunged down.</p>

<p>Space flamed in front of them.
For just an instant the void
seemed filled with an angry,
bursting fire that lapped with
hungry tongues of cold, blue light
toward the distant planets. A
flare so intense that it was visible
on the Jovian worlds, three hundred
million miles away. It lighted
the night-side of Earth, blotting
out the stars and Moon,
sending astronomers scurrying for
their telescopes, rating foot-high
streamers in the night editions.</p>

<p>Slowly Russ turned around
and faced his friend.</p>

<p>"We have it, Greg," he said.
"We really have it. We've tested
the control formulas all along the
line. We know what we can do."</p>

<p>"We don't know it all yet," declared
Greg. "We know we can
make it work, but I have a feeling
we haven't more than skimmed
the surface possibilities."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Russ</span> sank into a chair and
stared about the room. They
knew they could generate alternating
current of any frequency
they chose by use of a special collector
apparatus. They could release
radiant energy in almost
any quantity they desired, in any
wave-length, from the longest
radio to the incredibly hard cosmics.
The electrical power they
could measure accurately and
easily by simple voltmeters and
ammeters. But radiant energy
was another thing. When it
passed all hitherto known bonds,
it would simply fuse any instrument
they might use to measure it.</p>

<p>But they knew the power they
generated. In one split second
they had burst the energy bonds
of a tiny bit of steel and that
energy had glared briefly more
hotly than the Sun.</p>

<p>"Greg," he said, "it isn't often
you can say that any event was
the beginning of a new era. You
can with this&mdash;the era of unlimited
power. It kind of scares me."</p>

<p>Up until a hundred years ago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
coal and oil and oxygen had been
the main power sources, but with
the dwindling of the supply of
coal and oil, man had sought another
way. He had turned back
to the old dream of snatching
power direct from the Sun. In the
year 2048 Patterson had perfected
the photo-cell. Then the Alexanderson
accumulators made it
possible to pump the life-blood of
power to the far reaches of the
System, and on Mercury and
Venus, and to a lesser extent on
Earth, great accumulator power
plants had sprung up, with Interplanetary,
under the driving genius
of Spencer Chambers, gaining
control of the market.</p>

<p>The photo-cell and the accumulator
had spurred interplanetary
trade and settlement. Until it had
been possible to store Sun-power
for the driving of spaceships and
for shipment to the outer planets,
ships had been driven by rocket
fuel, and the struggling colonies
on the outer worlds had fought a
bitter battle without the aid of
ready power.</p>

<p>Coal and oil there were in
plenty on the outer worlds, but
one other essential was lacking ...
oxygen. Coal on Mars, for instance,
had to burned under synthetic
air pressures, like the old
carburetor. The result was inefficiency.
A lot of coal burned, not
enough power delivered.</p>

<p>Even the photo-cells were inefficient
when attempts were made
to operate them beyond the Earth;
that was the maximum distance
for maximum Solar efficiency.</p>

<p>Russ dug into the pocket of his
faded, scuffed leather jacket and
hauled forth pipe and pouch.
Thoughtfully he tamped the tobacco
into the bowl.</p>

<p>"Three months," he said. "Three
months of damn hard work."</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed Wilson, "we
sure have worked."</p>

<p>Wilson's face was haggard, his
eyes red. He blew smoke through
his nostrils.</p>

<p>"When we get back, how about
us taking a little vacation?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Russ laughed. "You can if you
want to. Greg and I are keeping
on."</p>

<p>"We can't waste time," Manning
said. "Spencer Chambers
may get wind of this. He'd move
all hell to stop us."</p>

<p>Wilson spat out his cigarette.
"Why don't you patent what you
have? That would protect you."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Russ</span> grinned, but it was a sour
one.</p>

<p>"No use," said Greg. "Chambers
would tie us up in a mile of legal
red tape. It would be just like
walking up and handing it to
him."</p>

<p>"You guys go ahead and work,"
Wilson stated. "I'm taking a vacation.
Three months is too damn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
long to stay out in a spaceship."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem long to me,"
said Greg, his tone cold and
sharp.</p>

<p>No, thought Russ, it hadn't
seemed long. Perhaps the hours
had been rough, the work hard,
but he hadn't noticed. Sleep and
food had come in snatches. For
three months they had worked
in space, not daring to carry out
their experiments on Earth ...
frankly afraid of the thing they
had.</p>

<p>He glanced at Manning.</p>

<p>The three months had left no
mark upon him, no hint of fatigue
or strain. Russ understood
now how Manning had done the
things he did. The man was all
steel and flame. Nothing could
touch him.</p>

<p>"We still have a lot to do," said
Manning.</p>

<p>Russ leaned back and puffed
at his pipe.</p>

<p>Yes, there was a lot to do.
Transmission problems, for instance.
To conduct away such terrific
power as they knew they
were capable of developing would
require copper or silver bars as
thick as a man's thigh, and even
so at voltages capable of jumping
a two-foot spark gap.</p>

<p>Obviously, a small machine such
as they now had would be impractical.
No matter how perfectly
it might be insulated, the atmosphere
itself would not be an
insulator, with power such as this.
And if one tried to deliver the
energy as a mechanical rotation
of a shaft, what shaft could transmit
it safely and under control?</p>

<p>"Oh, hell," Russ burst out, "let's
get back to Earth."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Harry Wilson</span> watched the
couple alight from the aero-taxi,
walk up the broad steps and
pass through the magic portals
of the Martian Club. He could
imagine what the club was like,
the deference of the management,
the exotic atmosphere of the
dining room, the excellence of the
long, cold drinks served at the
bar. Mysterious drinks concocted
of ingredients harvested in the
jungles of Venus, spiced with produce
from the irrigated gardens
of Mars.</p>

<p>He puffed on the dangling
cigarette and shuffled on along
the airy highwalk. Below and
above him, all around him flowed
the beauty and the glamor, the
bravery and the splendor of New
York. The city's song was in his
ears, the surging noises that were
its voice.</p>

<p>Two thousand feet above his
head reared giant pinnacles of
shining metal, glinting in the
noonday sun, architecture that
bore the alien stamp of other
worlds.</p>

<p>Wilson turned around, stared
at the Martian Club. A man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
needed money to pass through
those doors, to taste the drinks
that slid across its bar, to sit and
watch its floor shows, to hear the
music of its orchestras.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood, hesitating,
as if he were trying to
make up his mind. He flipped
away the cigarette, turned on
his heel, walked briskly to the
automatic elevator which would
take him to the lower levels.</p>

<p>There, on the third level, he
entered a Mecho restaurant, sat
down at a table and ordered from
the robot waiter, pushing ivory-tipped
buttons on the menu before
him.</p>

<p>He ate leisurely, smoked ferociously,
thinking. Looking at his
watch, he saw that it was nearly
two o'clock. He walked to the
cashier machine, inserted the metallic
check with the correct
change and received from the
clicking, chuckling register the
disk that would let him out the
door.</p>

<p>"Thank you, come again," the
cashier-robot fluted.</p>

<p>"Don't mention it," growled
Wilson.</p>

<p>Outside the restaurant he
walked briskly. Ten blocks away
he came to a building roofing
four square blocks. Over the massive
doorway, set into the beryllium
steel, was a map of the
Solar System, a map that served
as a cosmic clock, tracing the
movement of the planets as they
swung in their long arcs around
the Sun. The Solar System was
straddled by glowing, golden letters.
They read: <span class="smcapl">INTERPLANETARY BUILDING</span>.</p>

<p>It was from here that Spencer
Chambers ruled his empire built
on power.</p>

<p>Wilson went inside.</p>

<hr class="tb" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>CHAPTER FOUR</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> new apparatus was set
up, a machine that almost
filled the laboratory ... a giant,
compact mass of heavy, solidly
built metal work, tied together by
beams of girderlike construction.
It was meant to stand up under
the hammering of unimaginable
power, the stress of unknown
spatial factors.</p>

<p>Slowly, carefully, Russell Page
tapped keys on the control board,
setting up an equation. Sucking
thoughtfully at his pipe, he
checked and rechecked them.</p>

<p>Harry Wilson regarded him
through squinted eyes.</p>

<p>"What the hell is going to happen
now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We'll have to wait and see,"
Russ answered. "We know what
we want to happen, what we
hope will happen, but we never
can be sure. We are working with
conditions that are entirely new."</p>

<p>Sitting beside a table littered
with papers, staring at the gigantic
machine before him, Gregory
Manning said slowly: "That thing
simply has to adapt itself to
spaceship drive. There's everything
there that's needed for
space propulsion. Unlimited power
from a minimum of fuel. Split-second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
efficiency. Entire independence
of any set condition, because
the stuff creates its own
conditions."</p>

<p>He slowly wagged his head.</p>

<p>"The secret is some place along
the line," he declared. "I feel that
we must be getting close to it."</p>

<p>Russ walked from the control
board to the table, picked up a
sheaf of papers and leafed through
them. He selected a handful and
shook them in his fist.</p>

<p>"I thought I had it here," he
said. "My math must have been
wrong, some factor that I didn't
include in the equation."</p>

<p>"You'll keep finding factors for
some time yet," Greg prophesied.</p>

<p>"Repulsion would have been
the answer," said Russ bitterly.
"And the Lord knows we have it.
Plenty of it."</p>

<p>"Too much," observed Wilson,
smoke drooling from his nostrils.</p>

<p>"Not too much," corrected
Greg. "Inefficient control. You
jump at conclusions, Wilson."</p>

<p>"The math didn't show that
progressive action," said Russ. "It
showed repulsion, negative gravity
that could be built up until it
would shoot the ship outside the
Solar System within an hour's
time. Faster than light. We don't
know how many times faster."</p>

<p>"Forget it," advised Greg. "The
way it stands, it's useless. You
get repulsion by progressive steps.
A series of squares with one constant
factor. It wouldn't be any
good for space travel. Imagine
trying to use it on a spaceship.
You'd start with a terrific jolt.
The acceleration would fade and
just when you were recovering
from the first jolt, you'd get a
second one and that second one
would iron you out. A spaceship
couldn't take it, let alone a human
body."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Maybe</span> this will do it," said
Wilson hopefully.</p>

<p>"Maybe," agreed Russ. "Anyhow
we'll try it. Equation 578."</p>

<p>"It might do the trick," said
Greg. "It's a new approach to the
gravity angle. The equation explains
the shifting of gravitational
lines, the changing and contortion
of their direction. Twist gravity
and you have a perfect space
drive. As good as negative gravity.
Better, perhaps, more easily
controlled. Would make for more
delicate, precise handling."</p>

<p>Russ laid down the sheaf of
papers, lit his pipe and walked
to the apparatus.</p>

<p>"Here goes," he said.</p>

<p>His hand went out to the power
lever, eased it in. With a roar
the material energy engine built
within the apparatus surged into
action, sending a flow of power
through the massive leads. The
thunder mounted in the room.
The laboratory seemed to shudder
with the impact.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Wilson, watching intently,
cried out, a brief, choked-off cry.
A wave of dizziness engulfed him.
The walls seemed to be falling
in. The room and the machine
were blurring. Russ, at the controls,
seemed horribly disjointed.
Manning was a caricature of a
man, a weird, strange figure that
moved and gestured in the mad
room.</p>

<p>Wilson fought against the dizziness.
He tried to take a step
and the floor seemed to leap up
and meet his outstretched foot,
throwing him off balance. His
cigarette fell out of his mouth,
rolled along the floor.</p>

<p>Russ was shouting something,
but the words were distorted,
loud one instant, rising over the
din of the apparatus, a mere
whisper the next. They made no
sense.</p>

<p>There was a peculiar whistling
in the air, a sound such as he had
never heard before. It seemed to
come from far away, a high, thin
shriek that was torture in one's
ears.</p>

<p>Giddy, seized with deathly
nausea, Wilson clawed his way
across the floor, swung open the
laboratory door and stumbled
outdoors. He weaved across the
lawn and clung to a sun dial,
panting.</p>

<p>He looked back at the laboratory
and gasped in disbelief. All
the trees were bent toward the
building, as if held by some
mighty wind. Their branches
straining, every single leaf standing
at rigid attention, the trees
were bending in toward the
structure. <i>But there was no wind.</i></p>

<p>And then he noticed something
else. No matter where the
trees stood, no matter in what
direction from the laboratory,
they all bent inward toward the
building ... and the whining,
thundering, shrieking machine.</p>

<p>Inside the laboratory an empty
bottle crashed off a table and
smashed into a thousand fragments.
The tinkling of the broken
glass was a silvery, momentary
sound that protested against
the blasting thrum of power that
shook the walls.</p>

<p>Manning fought along the floor
to Russ's side. Russ roared in his
ear: "Gravitational control! Concentration
of gravitational lines!"</p>

<p>The papers on the desk started
to slide, slithering onto the floor,
danced a crazy dervish across the
room. Liquids in the laboratory
bottles were climbing the sides
of glass, instead of lying at rest
parallel with the floor. A chair
skated, bucking and tipping crazily,
toward the door.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Russ</span> jerked the power lever
back to zero. The power hum
died. The liquids slid back to
their natural level, the chair
tipped over and lay still, papers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
fluttered gently downward.</p>

<p>The two men looked at one another
across the few feet of floor
space between them. Russ wiped
beads of perspiration from his
forehead with his shirt sleeve. He
sucked on his pipe, but it was
dead.</p>

<p>"Greg," Russ said jubilantly,
"we have something better than
anti-gravity! We have something
you might call <i>positive</i> gravity ...
gravity that we can control.
Your grandfather nullified gravity.
We've gone him one better."</p>

<p>Greg gestured toward the machine.
"You created an attraction
center. What else?"</p>

<p>"But the center itself is not
actually an attracting force. The
fourth dimension is mixed up in
this. We have a sort of fourth-dimensional
lens that concentrates
the lines of any gravitational
force. Concentration in the
fourth dimension turns the force
loose in three dimensions, but we
can take care of that by using
mirrors of our anti-entropy. We
can arrange it so that it turns the
force loose in only one dimension."</p>

<p>Greg was thoughtful for a moment.
"We can guide a ship by
a series of lenses," he declared
at last. "But here's the really important
thing. That field concentrates
the forces of gravity already
present. Those forces exist
throughout all of space. There
are gravitational lines everywhere.
We can concentrate them
in any direction we want to. In
reality, we fall toward the body
which originally caused the force
of gravitation, not to the concentration."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Russ</span> nodded. "That means we
can create a field immediately
ahead of the ship. The ship
would fall into it constantly, with
the concentration moving on
ahead. The field would tend to
break down in proportion to the
strain imposed and a big ship, especially
when you are building up
speed, would tend to enlarge it,
open it up. But the field could be
kept tight by supplying energy
and we have plenty of that ...
far more than we'd ever need.
We supply the energy, but that's
only a small part of it. The body
emitting the gravitational force
supplies the fulcrum that moves
us along."</p>

<p>"It would operate beyond the
planets," said Greg. "It would
operate equally well anywhere in
space, for all of space is filled
with gravitational stress. We
could use gravitational bodies
many light years away as the
driver of our ships."</p>

<p>A half-wild light glowed momentarily
in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Russ," he said, "we're going
to put space fields to work at
last."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>He walked to the chair, picked
it up and sat down in it.</p>

<p>"We'll start building a ship,"
he stated, "just as soon as we
know the mechanics of this gravity
concentration and control.
Russ, we'll build the greatest ship,
the fastest ship, the most powerful
ship the Solar System has
ever known!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Damn</span>," said Russ, "that
thing's slipped again."</p>

<p>He glared at the offending nut.
"I'll put a lock washer on it this
time."</p>

<p>Wilson stepped toward the
control board. From his perch on
the apparatus, Russ motioned
him away.</p>

<p>"Never mind discharging the
field," he said. "I can get around
it somehow."</p>

<p>Wilson squinted at him. "This
tooth is near killing me."</p>

<p>"Still got a toothache?" asked
Russ.</p>

<p>"Never got a wink of sleep
last night."</p>

<p>"You better run down to
Frisco and have it yanked out,"
suggested the scientist. "Can't
have you laid up."</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's right," agreed
Wilson. "Maybe I will. We got a
lot to do."</p>

<p>Russ reached out and clamped
his wrench on the nut, quickly
backed it off and slipped on the
washer. Viciously he tightened it
home. The wrench stuck.</p>

<p>Gritting his teeth on the bit of
his pipe, Russ cursed soundlessly.
He yanked savagely at the
wrench. It slipped from his hand,
hung for a minute on the nut and
then plunged downward, falling
straight into the heart of the new
force field they had developed.</p>

<p>Russ froze and watched, his
heart in his throat, mad thoughts
in his brain. In a flash, as the
wrench fell, he remembered that
they knew nothing about this
field. All they knew was that any
matter introduced in it suddenly
acquired an acceleration in the
dimension known as time, with
its normal constant of duration
reduced to zero.</p>

<p>When that wrench struck the
field, it would cease to exist! But
something else might happen, too,
something entirely unguessable.</p>

<p>The wrench fell only a few
feet, but it seemed to take long
seconds as Russ watched, frozen
in fascination.</p>

<p>He saw it strike the hazy glow
that defined the limits of the
field, saw it floating down, as if
its speed had been slowed by
some dense medium.</p>

<p>In the instant that hazy glow
intensified a thousand times&mdash;became
a blinding sun-burst! Russ
ducked his head, shielded his
eyes from the terrible blast of
light. A rending, shuddering thud
seemed to echo ... in space rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
than in air ... and both field
and wrench were gone!</p>

<p>A moment passed, then another,
and there was the heavy,
solid clanging thud of something
striking metal. This time the thud
was not in space, but a commonplace
noise, as if someone had
dropped a tool on the floor above.</p>

<p>Russ turned around and stared
at Wilson. Wilson stared back,
his mouth hanging open, the
smoldering, cigarette dangling
from his mouth.</p>

<p>"Greg!" Russ shouted, his cry
shattering the silence in the
laboratory.</p>

<p>A door burst open and Manning
stepped into the main laboratory
room, a calculation pad in
one hand, a pencil in the other.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"We have to find my wrench!"</p>

<p>"Your wrench?" Greg was
puzzled. "Can't you get another?"</p>

<p>"I dropped it into the field.
Its time-dimension was reduced
to zero. It became an 'instantaneous
wrench'."</p>

<p>"Nothing new in that," said
Greg, unruffled.</p>

<p>"But there is," persisted Russ.
"The field collapsed, you see.
Maybe the wrench was too big
for it to handle. And when the
field collapsed the wrench gained
a new time-dimension. I heard it.
We have to find it."</p>

<p>The three of them pounded up
the stairs to the room where Russ
had heard the thump. There was
nothing on the floor. They
searched the room from end to
end, then the other rooms. There
was no wrench.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour Greg
went back to the main laboratory,
brought back a portable fluoroscope.</p>

<p>"Maybe this will do the trick,"
he announced bleakly.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> did. They found the wrench
<i>inside the space between the
walls</i>!</p>

<p>Russ stared at the shadow in
the fluoroscope plate. Undeniably
it was the shadow of the wrench.</p>

<p>"Fourth dimension," he said.
"Transported in time."</p>

<p>The muscles in Greg's cheeks
were tensed, that old flame of excitement
burning in his eyes, but
otherwise his face was the mask
of old, the calm, almost terrible
mask that had faced a thousand
dangers.</p>

<p>"Power and time," he corrected.</p>

<p>"If we can control it," said
Russ.</p>

<p>"Don't worry. We can control
it. And when we can, it's the biggest
thing we've got."</p>

<p>Wilson licked his lips, dredged
a cigarette out of a pocket.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind," he said,
"I'll hit for Frisco tonight. This
tooth of mine is getting worse."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure, can't keep an aching
tooth," agreed Russ, thinking of
the wrench while talking.</p>

<p>"Can I take your ship?" asked
Wilson.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Russ.</p>

<p>Back in the laboratory they rebuilt
the field, dropped little ball
bearings in it. The ball bearings
disappeared. They found them
everywhere&mdash;in the walls, in
tables, in the floor. Some, still
existing in their new time-dimension,
hung in mid-air, invisible,
intangible, but there.</p>

<p>Hours followed hours, with the
sheet of data growing. Math machines
whirred and chuckled and
clicked. Wilson departed for San
Francisco with his aching tooth.
The other two worked on. By
dawn they knew what they were
doing. Out of the chaos of happenstance
they were finding rules
of order, certain formulas of behavior,
equations of force.</p>

<p>The next day they tried heavier,
more complicated things and
learned still more.</p>

<p>A radiogram, phoned from the
nearest spaceport, forty miles distant,
informed them that Wilson
would not be back for a few days.
His tooth was worse than he had
thought, required an operation
and treatment of the jaw.</p>

<p>"Hell," said Russ, "just when
he could be so much help."</p>

<p>With Wilson gone the two of
them tackled the controlling device,
labored and swore over it.
But finally it was completed.</p>

<p>Slumped in chairs, utterly exhausted,
they looked proudly at
it.</p>

<p>"With that," said Russ, "we can
take an object and transport it
any place we want. Not only that,
we can pick up any object from
an indefinite distance and bring
it to us."</p>

<p>"What a thing for a lazy burglar,"
Greg observed sourly.</p>

<p>Worn out, they gulped sandwiches
and scalding coffee, tumbled
into bed.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> outdoor camp meeting
was in full swing. The
evangelist was in his top form.
The sinners' bench was crowded.
Then suddenly, as the evangelist
paused for a moment's silence before
he drove home an important
point, the music came. Music
from the air. Music from somewhere
in the sky. The soft, heavenly
music of a hymn. As if an
angels' chorus were singing in the
blue.</p>

<p>The evangelist froze, one arm
pointing upward, with index finger
ready to sweep down and
emphasize his point. The sinners
kneeling at the bench were petrified.
The congregation was astounded.</p>

<p>The hymn rolled on, punctuated,
backgrounded by deep
celestial organ notes. The clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
voice of the choir swept high to
a bell-like note.</p>

<p>"Behold!" shrieked the evangelist.
"Behold, a miracle! Angels
singing for us! Kneel! Kneel and
pray!"</p>

<p>Nobody stood.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Andy McIntyre</span> was drunk
again. In the piteous glare
of mid-morning, he staggered
homeward from the poker party
in the back of Steve Abram's
harness shop. The light revealed
him to the scorn of the entire
village.</p>

<p>At the corner of Elm and
Third he ran into a maple tree.
Uncertainly he backed away, intent
on making another try. Suddenly
the tree spoke to him:</p>

<p>"Alcohol is the scourge of mankind.
It turns men into beasts. It
robs them of their brains, it shortens
their lives ..."</p>

<p>Andy stared, unable to believe
what he heard. The tree, he had
no doubt, was talking to him personally.</p>

<p>The voice of the tree went on:
"... takes the bread out of the
mouths of women and children.
Fosters crime. Weakens the moral
fiber of the nation."</p>

<p>"Stop!" screamed Andy. "Stop,
I tell you!"</p>

<p>The tree stopped talking. All
he could hear was the whisper of
wind among its autumn-tinted
leaves.</p>

<p>Suddenly running, Andy darted
around the corner, headed home.</p>

<p>"Begad," he told himself, "when
trees start talkin' to you it's time
to lay off the bottle!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> another town fifty miles distant
from the one in which the
tree had talked to Andy McIntyre,
another miracle happened
that same Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Dozens of people heard the
bronze statue of the soldier in
the courtyard speak. The statue
did not come to life. It stood as
ever, a solid piece of golden
bronze, in spots turned black and
green by weather. But from its
lips came words ... words that
burned themselves into the souls
of those who heard. Words that
exhorted them to defend the
principles for which many men
had died, to grasp and hold high
the torch of democracy and liberty.</p>

<p>In somber bitterness, the statue
called Spencer Chambers the
greatest threat to that liberty and
freedom. For, the statue said,
Spencer Chambers and Interplanetary
Power were waging an
economic war, a bloodless one,
but just as truly war as if there
were cannons firing and bombs
exploding.</p>

<p>For a full five minutes the
statue spoke and the crowd, growing
by the minute, stood dumbfounded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Then silence fell over the
courtyard. The statue stood as
before, unmoving, its timeless
eyes staring out from under the
ugly helmet, its hands gripping
the bayoneted rifle. A blue and
white pigeon fluttered softly
down, alighted on the bayonet,
looked the crowd over and then
flew to the courthouse tower.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Back</span> in the laboratory, Russ
looked at Greg.</p>

<p>"That radio trick gives me an
idea," he said. "If we can put a
radio in statues and trees without
interfering with its operation,
why can't we do the same thing
with a television set?"</p>

<p>Greg started. "Think of the
possibilities of that!" he burst
out.</p>

<p>Within an hour a complete
television sending apparatus was
placed within the field and a receptor
screen set up in the laboratory.</p>

<p>The two moved chairs in front
of the screen and sat down. Russ
reached out and pulled the
switch of the field control. The
screen came to life, but it was
only a gray blur.</p>

<p>"It's traveling too fast," said
Greg. "Slow it down."</p>

<p>Russ retarded the lever. "When
that thing's on full, it's almost
instantaneous. It travels in a time
dimension and any speed slower
than instantaneity is a modification
of that force field."</p>

<p>On the screen swam a panorama
of the mountains, mile after
mile of snow-capped peaks and
valleys ablaze with the flames
of autumn foliage. The mountains
faded away. There was
desert now and then a city. Russ
dropped the televisor set lower,
down into a street. For half an
hour they sat comfortably in
their chairs and watched men
and women walking, witnessed
one dog fight, cruised slowly up
and down, looking into windows
of homes, window-shopping in the
business section.</p>

<p>"There's just one thing wrong,"
said Greg. "We can see everything,
but we can't hear a sound."</p>

<p>"We can fix that," Russ told
him.</p>

<p>He lifted the televisor set
from the streets, brought it back
across the desert and mountains
into the laboratory.</p>

<p>"We have two practical applications
now," said Greg. "Space
drive and television spying. I
don't know which is the best.
Do you realize that with this
television trick there isn't a thing
that can be hidden from us?"</p>

<p>"I believe we can go to Mars
or Mercury or anywhere we want
to with this thing. It doesn't seem
to have any particular limits. It
handles perfectly. You can move
it a fraction of an inch as easily
as a hundred miles. And it's fast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Almost instantaneous. Not quite,
for even with our acceleration
within time, there is a slight lag."</p>

<p>By evening they had an audio
apparatus incorporated in the
set, had wired the screen for
sound.</p>

<p>"Let's put this to practical use,"
suggested Greg. "There's a show
at the New Mercury Theater in
New York I've been wanting to
see. Let's knock off work and
take in that show."</p>

<p>"Now," said Russ, "you really
have an idea. The ticket scalpers
are charging a fortune, and it
won't cost us a cent to get in!"</p>

<hr class="tb" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>CHAPTER FIVE</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Pine</span> roots burned brightly
in the fireplace, snapping
and sizzling as the blaze caught
and flamed on the resin. Deep in
an easy chair, Greg Manning
stretched his long legs out toward
the fire and lifted his glass, squinting
at the flames through the
amber drink.</p>

<p>"There's something that's been
worrying me a little," he said. "I
hadn't told you about it because
I figured it wasn't as serious as
it looked. Maybe it isn't, but it
looks funny."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Russ.</p>

<p>"The stock market," replied
Greg. "There's something devilish
funny going on there. I've
lost about a billion dollars in the
last two weeks."</p>

<p>"A <i>billion</i> dollars?" gasped
Russ.</p>

<p>Greg swirled the whiskey in
his glass. "Don't sound so horrified.
The loss is all on paper. My
stocks have gone down. Most of
them cut in half. Some even less
than that. Martian Irrigation is
down to 75. I paid 185 for it. It's
worth 200."</p>

<p>"You mean something has happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to the market?"</p>

<p>"Not to the market. If that was
it, I wouldn't worry. I've seen
the market go up and down.
That's nothing to worry about.
But the market, except for a
slight depression, has behaved
normally in these past two weeks.
It almost looks as if somebody
was out to get me."</p>

<p>"Who'd want to and why?"</p>

<p>Greg sighed. "I wish I knew.
I haven't really lost a cent, of
course. My shares can't stay
down for very long. The thing is
that right now I can't sell them
even for what I paid for them.
If I sold now I'd lose that billion.
But as long as I don't have to
sell, the loss is merely on paper."</p>

<p>He sipped at the drink and
stared into the fire.</p>

<p>"If you don't have to, what are
you worrying about?" asked Russ.</p>

<p>"Couple of things. I put that
stock up as collateral to get the
cash to build the spaceship. At
present prices, it will take more
securities than I thought. If the
prices continue to go down, I'll
have the bulk of my holdings
tied up in the spaceship. I might
even be forced to liquidate some
of it and that would mean an
actual loss."</p>

<p>He hunched forward in the
chair, stared at Russ.</p>

<p>"Another thing," he said grimly,
"is that I hate the idea of
somebody singling me out as a
target. As if they were going to
make a financial example of me."</p>

<p>"And it sounds as if someone
has," agreed Russ.</p>

<p>Greg leaned back again,
drained his glass and set it down.</p>

<p>"It certainly does," he said.</p>

<p>Outside, seen through the window
beside the fireplace, the
harvest moon was a shield of
silver hung in the velvet of the
sky. A lonesome wind moaned
in the pines and under the eaves.</p>

<p>"I got a report from Belgium
the other day," said Greg. "The
spaceship is coming along. It'll
be the biggest thing afloat in
space."</p>

<p>"The biggest and the toughest,"
said Russ, and Greg nodded silent
agreement.</p>

<p>The ship itself was being manufactured
at the great Space
Works in Belgium, but other
parts of it, apparatus, engines,
gadgets of every description, were
being manufactured at other
widely scattered points. Anyone
wondering what kind of ship the
finished product would be would
have a hard time gathering the
correct information, which, of
course, was the idea. The "anyone"
they were guarding against
was Spencer Chambers.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"We</span> need a better television
set," said Russ. "This one
we have is all right, but we need
the best there is. I wonder if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Wilson could get us one in Frisco
and bring it back."</p>

<p>"I don't see why not," said
Greg. "Send him a radio."</p>

<p>Russ stepped to the phone,
called the spaceport and filed the
message.</p>

<p>"He always stays at the Greater
Martian," he told Greg. "We'll
probably catch him there."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Two</span> hours later the phone
rang. It was the spaceport.</p>

<p>"That message you sent to Wilson,"
said the voice of the operator,
"can't be delivered. Wilson
isn't at the Greater Martian. The
clerk said he checked out for
New York last night."</p>

<p>"Didn't he leave a forwarding
address?" asked Russ.</p>

<p>"Apparently not."</p>

<p>Russ hung up the receiver,
frowning. "Wilson is in New
York."</p>

<p>Greg looked up from a sheet of
calculations.</p>

<p>"New York, eh?" he said and
then went back to work, but a
moment later he straightened
from his work. "What would Wilson
be doing in New York?"</p>

<p>"I wonder ..." Russ stopped
and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Greg. He
glanced out of the window, considering,
the muscles in his
cheeks knotting. "Russ, we both
are thinking the same thing."</p>

<p>"I hate to think it," said Russ
evenly. "I hate to think such a
thing about a man."</p>

<p>"One way to find out," declared
Greg. He rose from the
chair and walked to the television
control board, snapped the
switch. Russ took a chair beside
him. On the screen the mountains
danced weirdly as the set
rocketed swiftly away and then
came the glint of red and yellow
desert. Blackness blanked out the
screen as the set plunged into the
ground, passing through the curvature
of the Earth's surface. The
blackness passed and fields and
farms were beneath them on the
screen, a green and brown checkerboard
with tiny white lines that
were roads.</p>

<p>New York was in the screen
now. Greg's hand moved the control
and the city rushed up at
them, the spires speeding toward
them like plunging spears. Down
into the canyons plunged the set,
down into the financial district
with its beetling buildings that
hemmed in the roaring traffic.</p>

<p>Grimly, surely, Greg drove his
strange machine through New
York. Through buildings, through
shimmering planes, through men.
Like an arrow the television set
sped to its mark and then Greg's
hand snapped back the lever and
in the screen was a building that
covered four whole blocks. Above
the entrance was the famous Solar
System map and straddling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the map were the gleaming golden
letters: <span class="smcapl">INTERPLANETARY
BUILDING</span>.</p>

<p>"Now we'll see," said Greg.</p>

<p>He heard the whistle of the
breath in Russ's nostrils as the
television set began to move, saw
the tight grip Russ had upon the
chair arms.</p>

<p>The interior of the building
showed on the screen as he drove
the set through steel and stone,
offices and corridors and brief
glimpses of steel partitions, until
it came to a door marked: <span class="smcapl">SPENCER
CHAMBERS, PRESIDENT</span>.</p>

<p>Greg's hand twisted the control
slightly and the set went
through the door, into the office
of Spencer Chambers.</p>

<p>Four men were in the room&mdash;Chambers
himself; Craven, the
scientist; Arnold Grant, head of
Interplanetary's publicity department,
<i>and Harry Wilson</i>!</p>

<p>Wilson's voice came out of the
screen, a frantic, almost terrified
voice.</p>

<p>"I've told you all I know. I'm
not a scientist. I'm a mechanic.
I've told you what they're doing.
I can't tell you how they do it."</p>

<p>Arnold Grant leaned forward
in his chair. His face was twisted
in fury.</p>

<p>"There were plans, weren't
there?" he demanded. "There
were equations and formulas.
Why didn't you bring us some of
them?"</p>

<p>Spencer Chambers raised a
hand from the desk, waved it
toward Grant. "The man has told
us all he knows. Obviously, he
can't be any more help to us."</p>

<p>"You told him to go back and
see if he couldn't find something
else, didn't you?" asked Grant.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," Chambers told
him. "But apparently he couldn't
find it."</p>

<p>"I tried," pleaded Wilson. Perspiration
stood out on his forehead.
The cigarette in his mouth
was limp and dead. "One of them
was always there. I never could
get hold of any papers. I asked
questions, but they were too busy
to answer. And I couldn't ask too
much, because then they would
have suspected me."</p>

<p>"No, you couldn't do that,"
commented Craven with an open
sneer.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> the laboratory Russ pounded
the arm of his chair with a
clenched fist. "The rat sold us
out!"</p>

<p>Greg said nothing, but his face
was stony and his eyes were crystal-hard.</p>

<p>On the screen Chambers was
speaking to Wilson. "Do you
think you could find something
out if you went back again?"</p>

<p>Wilson squirmed in his chair.</p>

<p>"I'd rather not." His voice
sounded like a whimper. "I'm
afraid they suspect me now. I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
afraid of what they'd do if they
found out."</p>

<p>"That's his conscience," breathed
Russ in the laboratory. "I
never suspected him."</p>

<p>"He's right about one thing,
though," Greg said. "He'd better
not come back."</p>

<p>Chambers was talking again:
"You realize, of course, that you
haven't been much help to us.
You have only warned us that
another kind of power generation
is being developed. You've set us
on our guard, but other than that
we're no better off than we were
before."</p>

<p>Wilson bristled, like a cowardly
animal backed into a corner.
"I told you what was going on.
You can be ready for it now. I
can't help it if I couldn't find out
how all them things worked."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Chambers. "I
made a bargain with you and I
keep my bargains. I told you I
would pay you twenty thousand
dollars for the information you
gave me when you first came to
see me. I told you I'd pay you for
any further additional information
you might give. Also I promised
you a job with the company."</p>

<p>Watching the financier, Wilson
licked his lips. "That's right,"
he said.</p>

<p>Chambers reached out and
pulled a checkbook toward him,
lifted a pen from its holder. "I'm
paying you the twenty thousand
for the warning. I'm not paying
you a dime more, because you
gave me no other information."</p>

<p>Wilson leaped to his feet, started
to protest.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Chambers
coldly.</p>

<p>"But the job! You said you'd
give me a job!"</p>

<p>Chambers shook his head. "I
wouldn't have a man like you in
my organization. If you were a
traitor to one man, you would be
to another."</p>

<p>"But ... but ..." Wilson started
to object and then sat down, his
face twisted in something that
came very close to fear.</p>

<p>Chambers ripped the check out
of the book, waved it slowly in
the air to dry it. Then he arose
and held it out to Wilson, who
reached out a trembling hand
and took it.</p>

<p>"And now," said Chambers,
"good day, Mr. Wilson."</p>

<p>For a moment Wilson stood
uncertain, as if he intended to
speak, but finally he turned, without
a word, and walked through
the door.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> the laboratory Russ and
Greg looked at one another.</p>

<p>"Twenty thousand," said Greg.
"Why, that was worth millions."</p>

<p>"It was worth everything
Chambers had," said Russ, "because
it's the thing that's going to
wreck him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Their attention snapped back
to the screen.</p>

<p>Chambers was hunched over
his desk, addressing the other two.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen," he asked,
"what are we to do?"</p>

<p>Craven shrugged his shoulders.
There was a puzzled frown in the
eyes back of the thick-lensed
glasses. "We haven't much to go
on. Wilson doesn't know a thing
about it. He hasn't the brain to
grasp even the most fundamental
ideas back of the whole thing."</p>

<p>Chambers nodded. "The man
knew the mechanical setup perfectly,
but that was all."</p>

<p>"I've constructed the apparatus,"
said Craven. "It's astoundingly
simple. Almost too simple
to do the things Wilson said it
would do. He drew plans for it,
so clear that it was easy to duplicate
the apparatus. He himself
checked the machine and says it
is the same as Page and Manning
have. But there are thousands
of possible combinations
for hookups and control board
settings. Too many to try to go
through and hit upon the right
answer. Because, you see, one
slight adjustment in any one of a
hundred adjustments might do
the trick ... but which of those
adjustments do you have to
make? We have to have the formulas,
the equations, before we
can even move."</p>

<p>"He seemed to remember a few
things," said Grant hopefully.
"Certain rules and formulas."</p>

<p>Craven flipped both his hands
angrily. "Worse than nothing," he
exploded. "What Page and Manning
have done is so far in advance
of anything that anyone
else has even thought about that
we are completely at sea. They're
working with space fields, apparently,
and we haven't even
scratched the surface in that
branch of investigation. We simply
haven't got a thing to go on."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"No</span> chance at all?" asked
Chambers.</p>

<p>Craven shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>"At least you could try,"
snapped Grant.</p>

<p>"Now, wait," Chambers snapped
back. "You seem to forget
Dr. Craven is one of the best scientists
in the world today. I'm
relying on him."</p>

<p>Craven smiled. "I can't do anything
with what Page and Manning
have, but I might try something
of my own."</p>

<p>"By all means do so," urged
Chambers. He turned to Grant.
"I observed you have carried out
the plans we laid. Martian Irrigation
hit a new low today."</p>

<p>Grant grinned. "It was easy.
Just a hint here and there to the
right people."</p>

<p>Chambers looked down at his
hands, slowly closing into fists.
"We have to stop them some way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
any way at all. Keep up the rumors.
We'll make it impossible
for Greg Manning to finance this
new invention. We'll take away
every last dollar he has."</p>

<p>He glared at the publicity man.
"You understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Grant, "I understand
perfectly."</p>

<p>"All right," said Chambers.
"And your job, Craven, is to
either develop what Page has
found or find something we can
use in competition."</p>

<p>Craven growled angrily. "What
happens if your damn rumors
can't ruin Manning? What if I
can't find anything?"</p>

<p>"In that case," said Chambers,
"there are other ways."</p>

<p>"Other ways?"</p>

<p>Chambers suddenly smiled at
them. "I have a notion to call
Stutsman back to Earth."</p>

<p>Craven drummed his fingers
idly on the arm of his chair. "Yes,
I guess you do have other ways,"
he said.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Greg's</span> hand snapped the
switch and the screen suddenly
was blank as the televisor
set returned instantly to the
laboratory.</p>

<p>"That explains a lot of things,"
he said. "Among them what has
happened to my stocks."</p>

<p>Russ sat in his chair, numbed.
"That little weak-kneed, ratting
traitor, Wilson. He'd sell his
mother for a new ten-dollar bill."</p>

<p>"We know," said Greg, "and
Chambers doesn't know we know.
We'll follow every move he
makes. We'll know every one of
his plans."</p>

<p>Pacing up and down the room,
he was already planning their
campaign.</p>

<p>"There are still a few things to
do," he added. "A few possibilities
we may have overlooked."</p>

<p>"But will we have time?" asked
Russ.</p>

<p>"I think so. Chambers is going
to go slow. The gamble is too big
to risk any slip. He doesn't want
to get in bad with the law. There
won't be any strong-arm stuff ...
not until he recalls Stutsman
from Callisto."</p>

<p>He paused in mid-stride, stood
planted solidly on the floor.</p>

<p>"When Stutsman gets into the
game," he said, "all hell will break
loose."</p>

<p>He took a deep breath.</p>

<p>"But we'll be ready for it then!"</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER SIX</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"If</span> we can get television reception
with this apparatus of
ours," asked Greg, "what is to prevent
us from televising? Why
can't we send as well as receive?"</p>

<p>Russ drew doodles on a calculation
sheet. "We could. Just
something else to work out. You
must remember we're working in
a four-dimensional medium. That
would complicate matters a little.
Not like working in three dimensions
alone. It would ..."</p>

<p>He stopped. The pencil fell
from his finger and he swung
around slowly to face Manning.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?"
asked Greg.</p>

<p>"Look," said Russ excitedly.
"We're working in four dimensions.
And if we televised through
four dimensions, what would we
get?"</p>

<p>Greg wrinkled his brow. Suddenly
his face relaxed. "You don't
mean we can televise in <i>three</i> dimensions,
do you?"</p>

<p>"That's what it should work
out to," declared Russ. He swung
back to the table again, picked up
his pencil and jotted down equations.
He looked up from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
sheet. "Three-dimensional television!"
he almost whispered.</p>

<p>"Something new again," commented
Greg.</p>

<p>"I'll say it's new!"</p>

<p>Russ reached out and jerked a
calculator toward him. Rapidly
he set up the equations, pressed
the tabulator lever. The machine
gurgled and chuckled, clicked out
the result. Bending over to read
it, Russ sucked in his breath.</p>

<p>"It's working out right," he said.</p>

<p>"That'll mean new equipment,
lots of it," Greg pointed out. "Wilson's
gone, damn him. Who's going
to help us?"</p>

<p>"We'll do it ourselves," said
Russ. "When we're the only ones
here, we can be sure there won't
be any leak."</p>

<p>It took hours of work on the
math machines, but at the end of
that time Russ was certain of his
ground.</p>

<p>"Now we go to work," he said,
gleefully.</p>

<p>In a week's time they had built
a triple televisor, but simplifications
of the standard commercial
set gave them a mechanism
that weighed little more and was
far more efficient and accurate.</p>

<p>During the time the work went
on they maintained a watch over
both the office of Spencer Chambers
and the laboratory in which
Dr. Herbert Craven worked 16
hours a day. Unseen, unsuspected,
they were silent companions of
the two men during many hours.
They read what the men wrote,
read what was written to them,
heard what they said, saw how
they acted. Doing so, the pair in
the high mountain laboratory
gained a deep insight into the
characters of unsuspecting quarries.</p>

<p>"Both utterly ruthless," declared
Greg. "But apparently men
who are sincere in thinking that
the spoils belong to the strong.
Strange, almost outdated men.
You can't help but like Chambers.
He's good enough at heart. He
has his pet charities. He really, I
believe, wants to help the people.
And I think he actually believes
the best way to do it is to gain a
dictatorship over the Solar System.
That ambition rules everything
in his life. It has hardened
him and strengthened him. He
will crush ruthlessly, without a
single qualm, anything that
stands in his path. That's why
we'll have a fight on our hands."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Craven</span> seemed to be making
little progress. They could
only guess at what he was trying
to develop.</p>

<p>"I think," said Russ, "he's working
on a collector field to suck in
radiant energy. If he really gets
that, it will be something worth
having."</p>

<p>For hours Craven sat, an intent,
untidy, unkempt man, sunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
deep in the cushions of an easy
chair. His face was calm, with relaxed
jaw and eyes that seemed
vacant. But each time he would
rouse himself from the chair to
pencil new notations on the pads
of paper that littered his desk.
New ideas, new approaches.</p>

<p>The triple televisor was completed
except for one thing.</p>

<p>"Sound isn't so easy," said
Russ. "If we could only find a
way to transmit it as well as
light."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Greg, "why don't
you try a condenser speaker."</p>

<p>"A condenser speaker?"</p>

<p>"Sure, the gadget developed
way back in the 1920s. It hasn't
been used for years to my knowledge,
but it might do the trick."</p>

<p>Russ grinned broadly. "Hell,
why didn't I think of that? Here
I've been racking my brain for a
new approach, a new wrinkle ...
and exactly what I wanted was
at hand."</p>

<p>"Should work," declared Greg.
"Just the opposite of a condenser
microphone. Instead of radiating
sound waves mechanically, it radiates
a changing electric field
and this field becomes audible
directly within the ear. Even yet
no one seems to understand just
how it works, but it does ... and
that's good enough."</p>

<p>"I know," said Russ. "It really
makes no sound. In other words
it creates an electric field that
doubles for sound. It ought to be
just the thing because nothing
can stop it. Metal shielding can,
I guess, if it's thick enough, but
it's got to be pretty damn thick."</p>

<p>It took time to set the mechanism
up. Ready, the massive apparatus,
within which glowed a
larger and more powerful force
field, was operated by two monstrous
material energy engines.
The controls were equipped with
clockwork drives, designed so
that the motion of the Earth
could be nullified completely and
automatically for work upon outlying
planets.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Russ</span> stood back and looked at
it. "Stand in front of that
screen, Greg," he said, "and we'll
try it on you."</p>

<p>Greg stepped in front of the
screen. The purr of power came
on. Suddenly, materializing out of
the air, came Greg's projection.
Hazy and undefined at first, it
rapidly assumed apparent solidity.
Greg waved his arm; the
image moved its arm.</p>

<p>Russ left the controls and
walked across the laboratory to
inspect the image. Examined from
all sides, it looked solid. Russ
walked through it and felt nothing.
There was nothing there. It
was just a three-dimensional
image. But even from two feet
away, it was as if the man himself
stood there in all the actuality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of flesh and blood.</p>

<p>"Hello, Russ," the image whispered.
It held out a hand. "Glad
to see you again."</p>

<p>Laughing, Russ thrust out his
hand. It closed on nothing in mid-air,
but the two men appeared to
shake hands.</p>

<p>They tested the machine that
afternoon. Their images strode
above the trees, apparently walking
on thin air. Gigantic replicas
of Greg stood on a faraway mountain
top and shouted with a thunderous
voice. Smaller images, no
more than two inches high, shinnied
up a table leg.</p>

<p>Satisfied, they shut off the machine.</p>

<p>"That's one of the possibilities
you mentioned," suggested Russ.</p>

<p>Greg nodded grimly.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">An</span> autumn gale pelted the windows
with driving rain, and
a wild, wet wind howled through
the pines outside. The fire was
leaping and flaring in the fireplace.</p>

<p>Deep in his chair, Russ stared
into the flame and puffed at his
pipe.</p>

<p>"The factory wants more money
on the spaceship," said Greg
from the other chair. "I had to
put up some more shares as collateral
on a new loan."</p>

<p>"Market still going down?"
asked Russ.</p>

<p>"Not the market," replied Greg.
"My stocks. All of them hit new
lows today."</p>

<p>Russ dragged at the pipe
thoughtfully. "I've been thinking
about that stock business, Greg."</p>

<p>"So have I, but it doesn't seem
to do much good."</p>

<p>"Look," said Russ slowly, "what
planets have exchanges?"</p>

<p>"All of them except Mercury.
The Jovian exchange is at Ranthoor.
There's even one out at
Pluto. Just mining and chemical
shares listed, though."</p>

<p>Russ did not reply. Smoke
curled up from his pipe. He was
staring into the fire.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask?" Greg wanted
to know.</p>

<p>"Just something stirring around
in my mind. I was wondering
where Chambers does most of his
trading."</p>

<p>"Ranthoor now," said Greg.
"Used to do it on Venus. The listing
is larger there. But since he
took over the Jovian confederacy,
he switched his business to it.
The transaction tax is lower. He
saw to that."</p>

<p>"And the same shares are listed
on the Callisto market as on
the New York boards?"</p>

<p>"Naturally," said Greg, "only
not as many."</p>

<p>Russ watched the smoke from
his pipe. "How long does it take
light to travel from Callisto to
Earth?"</p>

<p>"Why, about 45 minutes, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
guess. Somewhere around there."
Greg sat upright. "Say, what's
light got to do with this?"</p>

<p>"A lot," said Russ. "All commerce
is based on the assumption
that light is instantaneous, but it
isn't. All business, anywhere
throughout the Solar System, is
based on Greenwich time. When
a noon signal sent out from Earth
reaches Mars, it's noon there, but
as a matter of fact, it is actually
15 minutes or so past noon. When
the same signal reaches Callisto,
the correct time for the chronometer
used in commerce would
be noon when it is really a quarter
to one. That system simplifies
things. Does away with varying
times. And it has worked all right
so far because there has been, up
to now, nothing that could go
faster than light. No news can
travel through space, no message,
no signal can be sent at any speed
greater than that. So everything
has been fine."</p>

<p>Greg had come out of the
chair, was standing on his feet,
the glow of the blaze throwing
his athletic figure into bold relief.
That calm exterior had been
stripped from him now. He was
excited.</p>

<p>"I see what you are getting at!
We have something that is almost
instantaneous!"</p>

<p>"Almost," said Russ. "Not quite.
There's a time lag somewhere.
But it isn't noticeable except over
vast distances."</p>

<p>"But it would beat ordinary
light signals to Callisto. It would
beat them there by almost 45
minutes."</p>

<p>"Almost," Russ agreed. "Maybe a
split second less."</p>

<p>Greg strode up and down in
front of the fireplace like a caged
lion. "By heaven," he said, "we've
got Chambers where we want
him. We can beat the stock quotations
to Callisto. With that advance
knowledge of what the
board is doing in New York, we
can make back every dime I've
lost. We can take Mr. Chambers
to the cleaners!"</p>

<p>Russ grinned. "Exactly," he
said. "We'll know 45 minutes in
advance of the other traders what
the market will be. Let's see
Chambers beat that."</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER SEVEN</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Ben Wrail</span> was taking things
easy. Stretched out in his
chair, with his cigar lit and burning
satisfactorily, he listened to a
radio program broadcast from
Earth.</p>

<p>Through the window beside
him, he could look out of his skyscraper
apartment over the
domed city of Ranthoor. Looming
in the sky, slightly distorted
by the heavy quartz of the distant
dome, was massive Jupiter,
a scarlet ball tinged with orange
and yellow. Overwhelmingly luminous,
monstrously large, it filled
a large portion of the visible sky,
a sight that brought millions of
tourists to the Jovian moons each
year, a sight that even the old-timers
still must stare at, drawn
by some unfathomable fascination.</p>

<p>Ben Wrail stared at it now,
puffing at his cigar, listening to
the radio. An awe-inspiring thing,
a looming planet that seemed almost
ready to topple and crash
upon this airless, frigid world.</p>

<p>Wrail was an old-timer. For
thirty years&mdash;Earth years&mdash;he
had made his home in Ranthoor.
He had seen the city grow from
a dinky little mining camp enclosed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
by a small dome to one
that boasted half a million population.
The dome that now covered
the city was the fourth one.
Four times, like the nautilus, the
city had outgrown its shell, until
today it was the greatest domed
city in the Solar System. Where
life had once been cheap and
where the scum of the system had
held rendezvous, he had seen
Ranthoor grow into a city of dignity,
capital of the Jovian confederacy.</p>

<p>He had helped build that confederacy,
had been elected a
member of the constitution commission,
had helped create the
government and for over a decade
had helped to make its laws.</p>

<p>But now ... Ben Wrail spat angrily
and stuffed the cigar back
in his mouth again, taking a fresh
and fearsome grip. Now everything
had changed. The Jovian
worlds today were held in bond
by Spencer Chambers. The government
was in the hands of his
henchmen. Duly elected, of course,
but in an election held under the
unspoken threat that Interplanetary
Power would withdraw, leaving
the moons circling the great
planet without heat, air, energy.
For the worlds of the Jovian confederacy,
every single one of
them, depended for their life upon
the accumulators freighted
outward from the Sun.</p>

<p>Talk of revolt was in the air,
but, lacking a leader, it would
get nowhere. John Moore Mallory
was imprisoned on one of
the prison spaceships that plied
through the Solar System. Mallory,
months ago, had been secretly
transferred from the
Callisto prison to the spaceship,
but in a week's time the secret
had been spread in angry whispers.
If there had been riots and
bloodshed, they would have been
to no purpose. For revolution,
even if successful, would gain
nothing. It would merely goad
Interplanetary Power into withdrawing,
refusing to service the
domed cities on the moons.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Ben Wrail</span> stirred restlessly
in his chair. The cigar had
gone out. The radio program
blared unheard. His eyes still
looked out the window without
seeing Jupiter.</p>

<p>"Damn," said Ben Wrail. Why
did he have to go and spoil an
evening thinking about this
damned political situation? Despite
his part in the building of
the confederacy, he was a businessman,
not a politician. Still, it
hurt to see something torn down
that he had helped to build,
though he knew that every pioneering
strike in history had been
taken over by shrewd, ruthless,
powerful operators. Knowing that
should have helped, but it didn't.
He and the other Jovian pioneers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
had hoped it wouldn't happen
and, of course, it had.</p>

<p>"Ben Wrail," said a voice in
the room.</p>

<p>Wrail swung around, away
from the window.</p>

<p>"Manning!" he yelled, and the
man in the center of the room
grinned bleakly at him. "How did
you come in without me hearing
you? When did you get here?"</p>

<p>"I'm not here," said Greg. "I'm
back on Earth."</p>

<p>"You're what?" asked Wrail
blankly. "That's a pretty silly
statement, isn't it, Manning? Or
did you decide to loosen up and
pull a gag now and then?"</p>

<p>"I mean it," said Manning.
"This is just an image of me. My
body is back on Earth."</p>

<p>"You mean you're dead? You're
a ghost?"</p>

<p>The grin widened, but the face
was bleak as ever.</p>

<p>"No, Ben, I'm just alive as you
are. Let me explain. This is a television
image of me. Three-dimensional
television. I can travel anywhere
like this."</p>

<p>Wrail sat down in the chair
again. "I don't suppose there'd be
any use trying to shake hands
with you."</p>

<p>"No use," agreed Manning's
image. "There isn't any hand."</p>

<p>"Nor asking you to have a
chair?"</p>

<p>Manning shook his head.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," said Wrail, "I'm
damn glad to see you&mdash;or think I
see you. I don't know which. Figure
you can stay and talk with
me a while?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Certainly</span>," said Manning.
"That is what I came
for. I want to ask your help."</p>

<p>"Listen," declared Wrail, "you
can't be on Earth, Manning. I say
something to you and you answer
right back. That isn't possible.
You can't hear anything I say until
45 minutes after I say it, and
then I'd have to wait another 45
minutes to hear your answer."</p>

<p>"That's right," agreed the image,
"if you insist upon talking
about the velocity of light. We
have something better than that."</p>

<p>"We?"</p>

<p>"Russell Page and myself. We
have a two-way television apparatus
that works almost instantaneously.
To all purposes, so far
as the distance between Earth
and Callisto is concerned, it is instantaneous."</p>

<p>Wrail's jaw fell. "Well, I be
damned. What have you two fellows
been up to now?"</p>

<p>"A lot," said Manning laconically.
"For one thing we are out
to bust Interplanetary Power.
Bust them wide open. Hear that,
Wrail?"</p>

<p>Wrail stared in stupefaction.
"Sure, I hear. But I can't believe
it."</p>

<p>"All right then," said Manning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
grimly, "we'll give you proof.
What could you do, Ben, if we
told you what was happening on
the stock market in New York ...
<i>without you having to wait the
45 minutes it takes the quotations
to get here</i>?"</p>

<p>Wrail sprang to his feet. "What
could I do? Why, I could run the
pants off every trader in the exchange!
I could make a billion a
minute!" He stopped and looked
at the image. "But this isn't like
you. This isn't the way you'd do
things."</p>

<p>"I don't want you to hurt anyone
but Chambers," said Manning.
"If somebody else gets in
the way, of course they have to
take the rap along with him. But
I do want to give Chambers a
licking. That's what I came here
to see you about."</p>

<p>"By Heaven, Greg, I'll do it,"
said Wrail. He stepped quickly
forward, held out his hand to
close the deal, and encountered
only air.</p>

<p>Manning's image threw back
its head and laughed.</p>

<p>"That's your proof, Ben. Good
enough?"</p>

<p>"I'll say it is," said Wrail shakily,
looking down at the solid-seeming
hand that his own had
gone right through.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">November</span> 6, 2153, was a
day long remembered in financial
circles throughout the Solar
System. The Ranthoor market
opened easy with little activity.
Then a few stocks made fractional
gains. Mining dropped fractionally.
Martian Irrigation still
was unexplainably low, as was
Pluto Chemical and Asteroid
Mining.</p>

<p>Trading through two brokers,
Ben Wrail bought 10,000 shares
of Venus Farms, Inc. when the
market opened at 83&frac12;. A few
minutes later they bought 10,000
shares of Spacesuits Ltd. at 106&frac14;.
The farm stocks dropped off a
point. Spacesuits gained a point.
Then suddenly both rose. In the
second hour of trading the Venus
stocks had boomed a full five
points and Wrail sold. Ten minutes
later they sagged. At the end
of the day they were off two
points from the opening. In late
afternoon Wrail threw his 10,000
shares of Spacesuits on the market,
sold them at an even 110.
Before the close they had
dropped back with a gain of only
half a point over the opening.</p>

<p>Those were only two transactions.
There were others. Spaceship
Fabrication climbed three
points before it fell and Wrail
cashed in on that. Mercury Metals
rose two points and crashed back
to close with a full point loss.
Wrail sold just before the break.
He had realized a cool half million
in the day's trade.</p>

<p>The next day it was a million<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and then the man who had always
been a safe trader, who had
always played the conservative
side of the market, apparently
sure of his ground now, plunged
deeper and deeper. It was uncanny.
Wrail knew when to buy
and when to sell. Other traders
watched closely, followed his
lead. He threw them off by using
different brokers to disguise his
transactions.</p>

<p>Hectic day followed hectic day.
Ben Wrail did not appear on the
floor. Calls to his office netted
exactly nothing. Mr. Wrail was
not in. So sorry.</p>

<p>His brokers, well paid, were
close-mouthed. They bought and
sold. That was all.</p>

<p>Seated in his office, Ben Wrail
was busy watching two television
screens before him. One showed
the board in the New York exchange.
In the other was the
image of Gregory Manning,
hunched in a chair in Page's
mountain laboratory back on
Earth. And before Greg likewise
were two screens, one showing
the New York exchange board,
the other trained on Ben Wrail's
office.</p>

<p>"That Tourist stuff looks good,"
said Greg. "Why not buy a block
of it? I happen to know that
Chambers owns a few shares.
He'll be dabbling in it."</p>

<p>Ben Wrail grinned. "It's made
a couple of points, hasn't it? It's
selling here for 60 right now. In
45 minutes it'll be quoted at 62."</p>

<p>He picked up a telephone. "Buy
all you can of Tourist," he said.
"Right away. I'll tell you when
to sell. Get rid of whatever you
have in Titan Copper at 10:30."</p>

<p>"Better let go of your holdings
of Ranthoor Dome," suggested
Greg. "It's beginning to slip."</p>

<p>"I'll watch it," promised Ben.
"It may revive."</p>

<p>They lapsed into silence,
watching the board in New York.</p>

<p>"You know, Greg," said Ben
finally, "I really didn't believe
all this was true until I saw those
credit certificates materialize on
my desk."</p>

<p>"Simple," grunted Greg. "This
thing we've got can take anything
any place. I could reach out
there, grab you up and have you
down here in a split second."</p>

<p>Ben sucked his breath in between
his teeth. "I'm not doubting
anything any more. You sent
me half a billion two days ago.
It's more than doubled now."</p>

<p>He picked up the phone again
and spoke to his broker on the
other end.</p>

<p>"Unload Ranthoor Dome when
she reaches 79."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> real furor came on the
Ranthoor floor when Wrail
cornered Titan Copper. Striking
swiftly, he purchased the stock
in huge blocks. The shares rocketed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
as the exchanges throughout
the System were thrown into an
uproar. Under the cover of the
excitement he proceeded to corner
Spacesuits Ltd. Spacesuits
zoomed.</p>

<p>For two days the main exchanges
on four worlds were in
a frenzy as traders watched the
shares climb swiftly. Operators
representing Interplanetary Power
made offerings. No takers were
reported. The shares climbed.</p>

<p>Within one hour, however, the
entire Wrail holdings in both
stocks were dumped on the market.
The Interplanetary Power
traders, frantic over the prospect
of losing control of the two important
issues, bought heavily.
The price plummeted.</p>

<p>Spencer Chambers lost three
billion or more on the deal. Overnight
Ben Wrail had become a
billionaire many times over. Greg
Manning added to his own fortune.</p>

<p>"We have enough," said Greg.
"We've given Chambers what he
had coming to him. Let's call it
off."</p>

<p>"Glad to," agreed Ben. "It was
just too damned easy."</p>

<p>"Be seeing you, Ben."</p>

<p>"I'll get down to Earth some
day. Come see me when you
have a minute. Drop in for an
evening."</p>

<p>"That's an invitation," said
Greg. "It's easy with this three-dimension
stuff."</p>

<p>He reached out a hand, snapped
a control. The screens in Wrail's
office went dead.</p>

<p>Wrail reached for a cigar, lit
it carefully. He leaned back in
his chair, put his feet on the desk.</p>

<p>"By Heaven," he said satisfiedly,
"I've never enjoyed anything
so much in all my life."</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER EIGHT</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;giant</span> cylindrical hull of
finest beryl steel, the ship
loomed in the screen. A mighty
ship, braced into absolute rigidity
by monster cross beams of shining
steel. Glowing under the
blazing lamps that lighted the
scene, it towered into the shadows
of the factory, dwarfing the
scurrying workmen who swarmed
over it.</p>

<p>"She's a beauty," said Russ,
puffing at his pipe.</p>

<p>Greg nodded agreement.
"They're working on her day and
night to get her finished. We may
need it some day and need it in
a hurry. If Chambers really gets
that machine of his to rolling,
space will be the only place big
enough to hide in."</p>

<p>He chuckled, a grim chuckle,
deep in his throat.</p>

<p>"But we won't have to hide
long. Just until we get organized
and then will come the time
when we'll call for the showdown.
Chambers will have to spread his
cards."</p>

<p>Russ snapped the television
switch and the screen went blank.
The laboratory suddenly was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
place of queer lights and shadows,
bulging with grotesque machines,
with sprawling apparatus,
a place that hinted darkly of
vast power and mighty forces.</p>

<p>The scientist sat up in his
chair. "We've come a long way,
Greg. A long, long way. We have
the greatest power man has ever
known; we have an almost incomprehensible
space drive; we
have three-dimensional television."</p>

<p>"And," said Greg dryly, "we
took Chambers to the cleaners on
the market."</p>

<p>They sat in silence. Greg
smelled the smoke from Russ's
pipe, mixed with the taint of
lubricant and the faint lingering
scent of ionized air.</p>

<p>"We mustn't underrate Chambers,
however," he declared. "The
man made one mistake. He underrated
us. We can't repeat his
mistake. He is dangerous all the
time. He will stop at nothing.
Not even murder."</p>

<p>"He's going easy now," said
Russ. "He's hoping Craven can
find something that will either
equal our stuff or beat it. But
Craven isn't having any luck.
He's still driving himself on the
radiation theory, but he doesn't
seem to make much headway."</p>

<p>"If he got it, just what would
it mean?"</p>

<p>"Plenty. With that he could
turn all radiations in space to
work. The cosmics, heat, light,
everything. Space is full of radiation."</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for Wilson,"
Greg said, his voice a snarl, "we
wouldn't have to be worrying
about Chambers. Chambers
wouldn't know until we were
ready to let him know."</p>

<p>"Wilson!" ejaculated Russ, suddenly
leaning forward. "I had
forgotten about Wilson. What do
you say we try to find him?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Harry Wilson</span> sat at his
table in the Martian Club
and watched the exotic Martian
dance, performed by near-nude
girls. Smoke trailed up lazily
from his drooping cigarette as he
watched through squinted eyes.
There was something about the
dance that got under Wilson's
skin.</p>

<p>The music rose, then fell to
whispering undertones and suddenly,
unexpectedly, crashed and
stopped. The girls were running
from the floor. A wave of smooth,
polite applause rippled around
the tables.</p>

<p>Wilson sighed and reached for
his wine glass. He crushed the
cigarette into a tray and sipped
his wine. He glanced around the
room, scanning the bobbing,
painted faces of the night&mdash;the
great, the near-great, the near-enough-to-touch-the-great.
Brokers and businessmen, artists and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
writers and actors. There were
others, too, queer night-life shadows
that no one knew much
about, or that one heard too
much about ... the playboys and
the ladies of family and fortune,
correctly attired men, gorgeously,
sleekly attired women.</p>

<p>And&mdash;Harry Wilson. The waiters
called him Mr. Wilson. He
heard people whispering about
him asking who he was. His soul
soaked it in and cried for more.
Good food, good drinks, the pastels
of the walls, the soft lights
and weird, exotic music. The cold
but colorful correctness of it all.</p>

<p>Just two months ago he had
stood outside the club, a stranger
in the city, a mechanic from a
little out-of-the-way laboratory,
a man who was paid a pittance
for his skill. He had stood outside
and watched his employers walk
up the steps and through the
magic doors. He had watched in
bitterness....</p>

<p>But now!</p>

<p>The orchestra was striking up
a tune. A blonde nodded at him
from a near-by table. Solemnly,
with the buzz of wine in his
brain and its hotness in his blood,
he returned the nod.</p>

<p>Someone was speaking to him,
calling him by name. He looked
around, but there was no one
looking at him now. And once
again, through that flow of music,
through the hum of conversation,
through the buzzing of his own
brain, came the voice, cold and
sharp as steel:</p>

<p>"Harry Wilson!"</p>

<p>It sent a shudder through him.
He reached for the wine glass
again, but his hand stopped half-way
to the stem, paused and
trembled at what he saw.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">For</span> there was a gray vagueness
in front of him, a sort of
shimmer of nothingness, and out
of that shimmer materialized a
pencil.</p>

<p>As he watched, in stricken terror,
the point of the pencil
dropped to the tablecloth and
slowly, precisely, it started to
move. He stared, hypnotized, unbelieving,
with the fingers of madness
probing at his brain. The
pencil wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Wilson, you sold me out.</p></div>

<p>The man at the table tried to
speak, tried to shriek, but his
tongue and throat were dry and
only harsh breath rattled in his
mouth.</p>

<p>The pencil moved on mercilessly:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>But you will pay. No matter where
you go, I will find you. You cannot
hide from me.</p></div>

<p>The pencil slowly lifted its
point from the table and suddenly
was gone, as if it had never
been. Wilson, eyes wide and filled
with terrible fear, stared at the
black words on the cloth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Wilson, you sold me out. But you
will pay. No matter where you go, I
will find you. You cannot hide from me.</p></div>

<p>The music pulsated in the
room, the hum of conversation
ran like an undertone, but Wilson
did not hear. His entire consciousness
was centered on the
writing, the letters and the words
that filled his soul with dread.</p>

<p>Something seemed to snap
within him. The cold wind of
terror reached out and struck at
him. He staggered from the chair.
His hand swept the wine glass
from the table and it shattered
into chiming shards.</p>

<p>"They can't do this to me!" he
shrieked.</p>

<p>There was a silence in the
room a silence of terrible accusation.
Everyone was staring at
him. Eyebrows raised.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;waiter</span> was at his elbow.
"Do you feel ill, sir?"</p>

<p>And then, on unsteady feet, he
was being led away. Behind him
he heard the music once again,
heard the rising hum of voices.</p>

<p>Someone set his hat on his
head, was holding his coat. The
cold air of the night struck his
face and the doors sighed closed
behind him.</p>

<p>"I'd take it easy going down
the step, sir," counseled the doorman.</p>

<p>An aero-taxi driver held open
the door of the cab and saluted.</p>

<p>"Where to, sir?"</p>

<p>Wilson stumbled in and stammered
out his address. The taxi
droned into the traffic lane.</p>

<p>Hands twitching, Wilson fumbled
with the key, took minutes
to open the door into his apartment.
Finally the lock clicked
and he pushed open the door. His
questing finger found the wall
switch. Light flooded the room.</p>

<p>Wilson heaved a sigh of relief.
He felt safe here. This place belonged
to him. It was his home,
his retreat....</p>

<p>A low laugh, hardly more than
a chuckle, sounded behind him.
He whirled and for a moment,
blinking in the light, he saw nothing.
Then something stirred by
one of the windows, gray and
vague, like a sheet of moving fog.</p>

<p>As he watched, shrinking back
against the wall, the grayness
deepened, took the form of a
man. And out of that mistiness a
face was etched, a face that had
no single line of humor in it, a
bleak face with the fire of anger
in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Manning!" shrieked Wilson.
"Manning!" He wheeled and
sprinted for the door, but the
gray figure moved, too ... incredibly
fast, as if it were wind-blown
vapor, and barred his path
to the door.</p>

<p>"Why are you running away?"
Manning's voice mocked. "Certainly
you aren't afraid of me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look," Wilson whimpered, "I
didn't think of what it meant. I
just was tired of working the way
Page made me work. Tired of
the little salary I got. I wanted
money. I was hungry for money."</p>

<p>"So you sold us out," said
Manning.</p>

<p>"No," cried Wilson, "I didn't
think of it that way. I didn't stop
to think."</p>

<p>"Think now, then," said Manning
gravely. "Think of this. No
matter where you are, no matter
where you go, no matter what
you do, I'll always be watching
you, I'll never let you rest. I'll
never give you a minute's peace."</p>

<p>"Please," pleaded Wilson.
"Please, go away and leave me.
I'll give you back the money ...
there's some of it left."</p>

<p>"You sold out for twenty thousand,"
said Manning. "You could
have gotten twenty million.
Chambers would have paid that
much to know what you could
tell him, because it was worth
twenty billion."</p>

<p>Wilson's breath was coming in
panting gasps. He dropped his
coat and backed away. The back
of his knees collided with a chair
and he folded up, sat down heavily,
still staring at the gray mistiness
that was a man.</p>

<p>"Think of that, Wilson," Manning
went on sneeringly. "You
could have been a millionaire.
Maybe even a billionaire. You
could have had all the fine things
these other people have. But you
only got twenty thousand."</p>

<p>"What can I do?" begged
Wilson.</p>

<p>The misty face split in a sardonic
grin.</p>

<p>"I don't believe there's anything
left for you to do."</p>

<p>Before Wilson's eyes the face
dissolved, lost its lines, seemed
to melt away. Only streaming,
swirling mist, then a slight refraction
in the air and then nothing.</p>

<p>Slowly Wilson rose to his feet,
reached for the bottle of whiskey
on the table. His hand shook so
that the liquor splashed. When
he raised the glass to his mouth,
his still-shaking hand poured half
the drink over his white shirt
front.</p>

pressed his thin, straight
lips together. "So that's the setup,"
he said.</p>

<p>Across the desk Spencer Chambers
studied the man. Stutsman
was like a wolf, lean and cruel
and vicious. He even looked like
a wolf, with his long, thin face,
his small, beady eyes, the thin,
bloodless lips. But he was the
kind of man who didn't always
wait for instructions, but went
ahead and used his own judgment.
And in a ruthless sort of
way, his judgment was always
right.</p>

<p>"Only as a last resort," cautioned
Chambers, "do I want you
to use the extreme measures you
are so fond of using. If they
should prove necessary, we can
always use them. But not yet. I
want to settle this thing in the
quietest way possible. Page and
Manning are two men who can't
simply disappear. There'd be a
hunt, an investigation, an ugly
situation."</p>

<p>"I understand," agreed Stutsman.
"If something should happen
to their notes, if somebody
could find them. Perhaps you. If
you found them on your desk
one morning."</p>

<p>The two men measured one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
another with their eyes, more like
enemies than men working for
the same ends.</p>

<p>"Not my desk," snapped Chambers,
"Craven's. So that Craven
could discover this new energy.
Whatever Craven discovers belongs
to Interplanetary."</p>

<p>Chambers rose from his chair
and walked to the window, looked
out. After a moment's time, he
turned and walked back again,
sat down in his chair. Leaning
back, he matched his fingertips,
his teeth flashing in a grin under
his mustache.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about
what's going on," he said. "I don't
even know someone has discovered
material energy. That's up
to Craven. He has to find it. Both
you and Craven work alone. I
know nothing about either of
you."</p>

<p>Stutsman's jaw closed like a
steel trap. "I've always worked
alone."</p>

<p>"By the way," said Chambers,
the edge suddenly off his voice,
"how are things going in the
Jovian confederacy? I trust you
left everything in good shape."</p>

<p>"As good as could be expected,"
Stutsman replied. "The people
are still uneasy, half angry. They
still remember Mallory."</p>

<p>"But Mallory," objected Chambers,
"is on a prison ship. In near
Mercury now, I believe."</p>

<p>Stutsman shook his head.
"They still remember him. We'll
have trouble out there one of
these days."</p>

<p>"I would hate to have that
happen," remarked Chambers
softly. "I would regret it very
much. I sent you out there to see
that nothing happened."</p>

<p>"The trouble out there won't
be a flash to this thing you were
telling me about," snapped Stutsman.</p>

<p>"I'm leaving that in your hands,
too," Chambers told him. "I know
you can take care of it."</p>

<p>Stutsman rose. "I can take care
of it."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you can," Chambers
said.</p>

<p>He remained standing after
Stutsman left, looking at the door
through which the man had gone.
Maybe it had been a mistake to
call Stutsman in from Callisto.
Maybe it was a mistake to use
Stutsman at all. He didn't like
a lot of things the man did ... or
the way he did them. Brutal
things.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Slowly</span> Chambers sat down
again and his face grew hard.</p>

<p>He had built an empire of
many worlds. That couldn't be
done with gentle methods and no
sure goal. Fighting every inch
from planet to planet, he had
used power to gain power. And
now that empire was threatened
by two men who had found a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
greater power. That threat had
to be smashed! It would be
smashed!</p>

<p>Chambers leaned forward and
pressed a buzzer.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Chambers?" said a
voice in the communicator.</p>

<p>"Send Dr. Craven in," commanded
Chambers.</p>

<p>Craven came in, slouchily, his
hair standing on end, his eyes
peering through the thick-lensed
glasses.</p>

<p>"You sent for me," he growled,
taking a chair.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," said Chambers.
"Have a drink?"</p>

<p>"No. And no smoke either."</p>

<p>Chambers took a long cigar
from the box on his desk, clipped
off the end and rolled it in his
mouth.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"I'm</span> a busy man," Craven reminded
him.</p>

<p>Puckering lines of amusement
wrinkled Chambers' eyes as he lit
up, watching Craven.</p>

<p>"You do seem to be busy, Doctor,"
he said. "I only wish you
had something concrete to report."</p>

<p>The scientist bristled. "I may
have in a few days, if you leave
me alone and let me work."</p>

<p>"I presume that you are still
working on your radiation collector.
Any progress?"</p>

<p>"Not too much. You can't expect
a man to turn out discoveries
to order. I'm working almost
night and day now. If the thing
can be solved, I'll solve it."</p>

<p>Chambers glowed. "Keep up
the good work. But I wanted to
talk to you about something else.
You heard, I suppose, that I lost
a barrel of money on the
Ranthoor exchange."</p>

<p>Craven smiled, a sardonic twisting
of his lips. "I heard something
about it."</p>

<p>"I thought you had," said
Chambers sourly. "If not, you
would have been the only one
who hadn't heard how Ben Wrail
took Chambers for a ride."</p>

<p>"He really took you then,"
commented Craven. "I thought
maybe it was just one of those
stories."</p>

<p>"He took me, but that's not
what's worrying me. I want to
know how he did it. No man, not
even the most astute student of
the market, could have foretold
the trend of the market the way
he did. And Wrail isn't the most
astute. It isn't natural when a
man who has always played the
safe side suddenly turns the market
upside down. Even less natural
when he never makes a mistake."</p>

<p>"Well," demanded Craven,
"what do you want me to do
about it? I'm a scientist. I've
never owned a share of stock in
my life."</p>

<p>"There's an angle to it that
might interest you," said Chambers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
smoothly, leaning back, puffing
at the cigar. "Wrail is a close
friend of Manning. And Wrail
himself didn't have the money it
took to swing those deals. Somebody
furnished that money."</p>

<p>"Manning?" asked Craven.</p>

<p>"What do you think?"</p>

<p>"If Manning's mixed up in it,"
said Craven acidly, "there isn't
anything any of us can do about
it. You're bucking money and
genius together. This Manning is
no slouch of a scientist himself
and Page is better. They're a
combination."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"You</span> think they're good?"
asked Chambers.</p>

<p>"Good? Didn't they discover
material energy?" The scientist
glowered at his employer. "That
ought to be answer enough."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," Chambers
agreed irritably. "But can you
tell me how they worked this
market deal?"</p>

<p>Craven grimaced. "I can guess.
Those boys didn't stop with just
finding how to harness material
energy. They probably have more
things than you can even suspect.
They were working with force
fields, you remember, when they
stumbled onto the energy. Force
fields are something we don't
know much about. A man monkeying
around with them is apt
to find almost anything."</p>

<p>"What are you getting at?"</p>

<p>"My guess would be that they
have a new kind of television
working in the fourth dimension,
using time as a factor. It would
penetrate anything. Nothing
could stop it. It could go anywhere,
at a speed many times the
speed of light ... almost instantaneously."</p>

<p>Chambers sat upright in his
chair. "Are you <i>sure</i> about this?"</p>

<p>Craven shook his head. "Just a
guess. I tried to figure out what
I would do if I were Page and
Manning and had the things they
had. That's all."</p>

<p>"And what would you do?"</p>

<p>Craven smiled dourly. "I'd be
using that television right in this
office," he said. "I'd keep you and
me under observation all the
time. If what I think is true,
Manning is watching us now and
has heard every word we said."</p>

<p>Chambers' face was a harsh
mask of anger. "I don't believe
it could be done!"</p>

<p>"Doctor Craven is right," said
a quiet voice.</p>

<p>Chambers swung around in his
chair and gasped. Greg Manning
stood inside the room, just in
front of the desk.</p>

<p>"I hope you don't mind," said
Greg. "I've been wanting to have
a talk with you."</p>

<p>Craven leaped to his feet, his
eyes shining. "Three dimensions!"
he whispered. "How did you do
it?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Greg chuckled. "I haven't patented
the idea, Doctor. I'd rather
not tell you just now."</p>

<p>"You will accept my congratulations,
however?" asked Craven.</p>

<p>"That's generous of you. I really
hadn't expected this much."</p>

<p>"I mean it," said Craven.
"Damned if I don't." Chambers
was on his feet, leaning across
the desk, with his hand held out.
Greg's right hand came out slowly.</p>

<p>"Sorry, I really can't shake
hands," he said. "I'm not here,
you know. Just my image."</p>

<p>Chambers' hand dropped to
the desk. "Stupid of me not to
realize that. You looked so natural."
He sat back in his chair again,
brushed his gray mustache. A
smile twisted his lips. "So you've
been watching me?"</p>

<p>"Off and on," Greg said.</p>

<p>"And what is the occasion of
this visit?" asked Chambers. "You
could have held a distinct advantage
by remaining unseen. I
didn't entirely believe what Craven
told me, you know."</p>

<p>"That isn't the point at all,"
declared Greg. "Maybe we can
get to understand one another."</p>

<p>"So you're ready to talk business."</p>

<p>"Not in the sense you mean,"
Greg said. "I'm not willing to
make concessions, but there's no
reason why we have to fight one
another."</p>

<p>"Why, no," said Chambers,
"there's no reason for that. I'll be
willing to buy your discovery."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't sell it to you," Greg
told him.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't? Why not? I'm
prepared to pay for it."</p>

<p>"You'd
pay the price, all right. Anything
I asked ... even if it bankrupted
you. Then you'd mark it down to
loss, and scrap material energy.
And I'll tell you why."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;terrible</span> silence hung in
the room as the two men
eyed one another across the table.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't use it," Greg
went on, "because it would remove
the stranglehold you have
on the planets. It would make
power too cheap. It would eliminate
the necessity of your rented
accumulators. The Jovian moons
and Mars could stand on their
feet without the power you ship
to them. You could make billions
in legitimate profits selling the
apparatus to manufacture the
energy ... but you wouldn't want
that. You want to be dictator of
the Solar System. And that is
what I intend to stop."</p>

<p>"Listen, Manning," said Chambers,
"you're a reasonable man.
Let's talk this thing over without
anger. What do you plan to do?"</p>

<p>"I could put my material engines
on the market," said Greg.
"That would ruin you. You
wouldn't move an accumulator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
after that. Your Interplanetary
stock wouldn't be worth the paper
it is written on. Material energy
would wipe you out."</p>

<p>"You forget I have franchises
on those planets," Chambers reminded
him. "I'd fight you in the
courts until hell froze over."</p>

<p>"I'd prove convenience, economy
and necessity. Any court in
any land, on any planet, would
rule for me."</p>

<p>Chambers shook his head. "Not
Martian or Jovian courts. I'd tell
them to rule for me and the
courts outside of Earth do what
I tell them to."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Greg</span> straightened and backed
from the desk. "I hate to
ruin a man. You've worked hard.
You've built a great company.
I would be willing, in return for
a hands-off policy on your part,
to hold up any announcement of
my material energy until you had
time to get out, to save what you
could."</p>

<p>Hard fury masked Chambers'
face. "You'll never build a material
energy engine outside your
laboratory. Don't worry about
ruining me. I won't allow you to
stand in my way. I hope you
understand."</p>

<p>"I understand too well. But
even if you are a dictator out on
Mars and Venus, even if you do
own Mercury and boss the Jovian
confederacy, you're just a man
to me. A man who stands for
things that I don't like."</p>

<p>Greg stopped and his eyes
were like ice crystals.</p>

<p>"You talked to Stutsman today,"
he said. "If I were you, I
wouldn't let Stutsman do anything
rash. Russ Page and I might
have to fight back."</p>

<p>Mockery tinged Chambers'
voice. "Am I to take this as a
declaration of war, Mr. Manning?"</p>

<p>"Take it any way you like,"
Greg said. "I came here to give
you a proposition, and you tell
me you're going to smash me. All
I have to say to you, Chambers,
is this&mdash;when you get ready to
smash me, you'd better have a
deep, dark hole all picked out for
yourself to hide in. Because I'll
hand you back just double anything
you hand out."</p>

<hr class="tb" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>CHAPTER TEN</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"One</span> of us will have to watch
all the time," Greg told
Russ. "We can't take any chances.
Stutsman will try to reach us
sooner or later and we have to
be ready for him."</p>

<p>He glanced at the new radar
screen they had set up that morning
beside the bank of other controls.
Any ship coming within a
hundred miles of the laboratory
would be detected instantly and
pinpointed.</p>

<p>The board flashed now. In the
screen they saw a huge passenger
ship spearing down toward the
airport south of them.</p>

<p>"With the port that close," said
Russ, "we'll get a lot of signals."</p>

<p>"I ordered the Belgium factory
to rush work on the ship," said
Greg. "But it will be a couple of
weeks yet. We just have to sit
tight and wait. As soon as we
have the ship we'll start in on
Chambers; but until we get the
ship, we just have to dig in and
stay on the defensive."</p>

<p>He studied the scene in the
screen. The ship had leveled off,
was banking in to the port. His
eyes turned away, took in the
laboratory with its crowding mass
of machinery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"We don't want to fool ourselves
about Chambers," he said.
"He may not have the power
here on Earth that he does on
the other planets, but he's got
plenty. Feeling the way he does,
he'll try to finish us off in a hurry
now."</p>

<p>Russ reached out to the table
that stood beside the bank of
controls and picked up a small,
complicated mechanism. Its face
bore nine dials, with the needles
on three of them apparently registering,
the other six motionless.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Greg.</p>

<p>"A mechanical detective," said
Russ. "A sort of mechanical shadow.
While you were busy with the
stock market stunt, I made several
of them. One for Wilson and
another for Chambers and still
another for Craven." He hoisted
and lowered the one in his hand.
"This one is for Stutsman."</p>

<p>"A shadow?" asked Greg. "Do
you mean that thing will trail
Stutsman?"</p>

<p>"Not only trail him," said Russ.
"It will find him, wherever he
may be. Some object every person
wears or carries is made of
iron or some other magnetic metal.
This 'shadow' contains a tiny
bit of that ridiculous military
decoration that Stutsman never
allows far away from him. Find
that decoration and you find
Stutsman. In another one I have
a chunk of Wilson's belt buckle,
that college buckle, you know,
that he's so proud of. Chambers
has a ring made of a piece of
meteoric iron and that's the bait
for another machine. Have a tiny
piece off Craven's spectacles in
his machine. It was easy to get
the stuff. The force field enables
a man to reach out and take anything
he wants to, from a massive
machine to a microscopic bit of
matter. It was a cinch to get the
stuff I needed."</p>

<p>Russ chuckled and put the machine
back on the table. He gestured
toward it.</p>

<p>"It maintains a tiny field similar
to our television field," he explained.
"But it's modified along
a special derivation with a magnetic
result. It can follow and
find the original mass of any metallic
substance it may contain."</p>

<p>"Clever," commented Greg.</p>

<p>Russ lit his pipe, puffed comfortably.
"We needed something
like that."</p>

<p>The red light on the board
snapped on and blinked. Russ
reached out and slammed home
the lever, twirled dials. It was
only another passenger ship. They
relaxed, but not too much.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"I&nbsp;wonder</span> what he's up to,"
said Russ.</p>

<p>Stutsman's car had stopped in
the dock section of New York.
Crumbling, rotting piers and old
tumbledown warehouses, deserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and unused since the last ship
sailed the ocean before giving
way to air commerce, loomed
darkly, like grim ghosts, in the
darkness.</p>

<p>Stutsman had gotten out of
the car and said: "Wait here."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the voice of the
driver.</p>

<p>Stutsman strode away, down a
dark street. The televisor kept
pace with him and on the screen
he could be seen as a darker
shape moving among the shadows
of that old, almost forgotten
section of the Solar System's
greatest city.</p>

<p>Another shadow detached itself
from the darkness of the
street, shuffled toward Stutsman.</p>

<p>"Sir," said a whining voice, "I
haven't eaten ..."</p>

<p>There was a swift movement
as Stutsman's stick lashed out, a
thud as it connected with the
second shadow's head. The shadow
crumpled on the pavement.
Stutsman strode on.</p>

<p>Greg sucked in his breath. "He
isn't very sociable tonight."</p>

<p>Stutsman ducked into an alley
where even deeper darkness lay.
Russ, with a delicate adjustment,
slid the televisor along,
closer to Stutsman, determined
not to lose sight of him for an
instant.</p>

<p>The man suddenly turned into
a doorway so black that nothing
could be seen. Sounds of sharp,
impatient rappings came out of
the screen as Stutsman struck the
door with his stick.</p>

<p>Brilliant illumination sprang
out over the doorway, but Stutsman
seemed not to see it, went
on knocking. The colors on the
screen were peculiarly distorted.</p>

<p>"Ultra-violet," grunted Greg.
"Whoever he's calling on wants to
have a good look before letting
anybody in."</p>

<p>The door creaked open and a
shaft of normal light spewed out
into the street, turning its murkiness
to pallid yellow.</p>

<p>Stutsman stepped inside.</p>

<p>The man at the door jerked
his head. "Back room," he said.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> televisor slid through the
door into the lighted room behind
Stutsman. Dust lay thick on
the woodwork and floors. Patches
of plaster had broken away. Furrows
zigzagged across the floor,
marking the path of heavy boxes
or furniture which had been
pushed along in utter disdain of
the flooring. Cheap wall-paper
hung in tatters from the walls,
streaked with water from some
broken pipe.</p>

<p>But the back room was a startling
contrast to the first. Rich,
comfortable furniture filled it. The
floor was covered with a steel-cloth
rug and steel-cloth hangings,
colorfully painted, hid the walls.</p>

<p>A man sat under a lamp, reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
a newspaper. He rose to his
feet, like the sudden uncoiling of
springs.</p>

<p>Russ gasped. That face was
one of the best known faces in
the entire Solar System. A ratlike
face, with cruel cunning printed
on it that had been on front
pages and TV screens often, but
never for pay.</p>

<p>"Scorio!" whispered Russ.</p>

<p>Greg nodded and his lips were
drawn tight.</p>

<p>"Stutsman," said Scorio, surprised.
"You're the last person in
the world I was expecting. Come
in. Have a chair. Make yourself
comfortable."</p>

<p>Stutsman snorted. "This isn't a
social call."</p>

<p>"I didn't figure it was," replied
the gangster, "but sit down anyway."</p>

<p>Gingerly Stutsman sat down
on the edge of a chair, hunched
forward. Scorio resumed his seat
and waited.</p>

<p>"I have a job for you," Stutsman
announced bluntly.</p>

<p>"Fine. It isn't often you have
one for me. Three-four years ago,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"We may be watched," warned
Stutsman.</p>

<p>The mobster started from his
chair, his eyes darting about the
room.</p>

<p>Stutsman grunted disgustedly.
"If we're watched, there isn't anything
we can do about it."</p>

<p>"We can't, huh?" snarled the
gangster. "Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because the watcher is on the
West Coast. We can't reach him.
If he's watching, he can see every
move we make, hear every word
we say."</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Greg Manning</span> or Russ
Page," said Stutsman.
"You've heard of them?"</p>

<p>"Sure. I heard of them."</p>

<p>"They have a new kind of television,"
said Stutsman. "They can
see and hear everything that's
happening on Earth, perhaps in
all the Solar System. But I don't
think they're watching us now.
Craven has a machine that can
detect their televisor. It registers
certain field effects they use. They
weren't watching when I left
Craven's laboratory just a few
minutes ago. They may have
picked me up since, but I don't
think so."</p>

<p>"So Craven has made a detector,"
said Greg calmly. "He can
tell when we're watching now."</p>

<p>"He's a clever cuss," agreed
Russ.</p>

<p>"Take a look at that machine
now," urged Scorio. "See if they're
watching. You shouldn't have
come here. You should have let
me know and I would have met
you some place. I can't have
people knowing where my hideout
is."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quiet down," snapped Stutsman.
"I haven't got the machine.
It weighs half a ton."</p>

<p>Scorio sank deeper into his
chair, worried. "Do you want to
take a chance and talk business?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. That's why I'm
here. This is the proposition.
Manning and Page are working
in a laboratory out on the West
Coast, in the mountains. I'll give
you the exact location later.
They have some papers we want.
We wouldn't mind if something
happened to the laboratory. It
might, for example blow up. But
we want the papers first."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Scorio</span> said nothing. His face
was quiet and cunning.</p>

<p>"Give me the papers," said
Stutsman, "and I'll see that you
get to any planet you want to.
And I'll give you two hundred
thousand in Interplanetary Credit
certificates. Give me proof that
the laboratory blew up or melted
down or something else happened
to it and I'll boost the figure to
five hundred thousand."</p>

<p>Scorio did not move a muscle
as he asked: "Why don't you
have some of your own mob do
this job?"</p>

<p>"Because I can't be connected
with it in any way," said Stutsman.
"If you slip up and something
happens, I won't be able
to do a thing for you. That's why
the price is high."</p>

<p>The gangster's eyes slitted. "If
the papers are worth that much
to you, why wouldn't they be
worth as much to me?"</p>

<p>"They wouldn't be worth a
dime to you."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because you couldn't read
them," said Stutsman.</p>

<p>"I can read," retorted the gangster.</p>

<p>"Not the kind of language
on those papers. There aren't
more than two dozen people in
the Solar System who could read
it, perhaps a dozen who could
understand it, maybe half a dozen
who could follow the directions
in the papers." He leaned
forward and jabbed a forefinger
at the gangster. "And there are
only two people in the System
who could write it."</p>

<p>"What the hell kind of a language
is it that only two dozen
people could read?"</p>

<p>"It isn't a language, really. It's
mathematics."</p>

<p>"Oh, arithmetic."</p>

<p>"No," Stutsman said. "Mathematics.
You see? You don't even
know the difference between the
two, so what good would the papers
do you?"</p>

<p>Scorio nodded. "Yeah, you're
right."</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER ELEVEN</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> Paris-Berlin express
thundered through the night,
a gigantic ship that rode high
above the Earth. Far below one
could see the dim lights of eastern
Europe.</p>

<p>Harry Wilson pressed his face
against the window, staring down.
There was nothing to see but the
tiny lights. They were alone, he
and the other occupants of the
ship ... alone in the dark world
that surrounded them.</p>

<p>But Wilson sensed some other
presence in the ship, someone
besides the pilot and his mechanics
up ahead, the hostess and the
three stodgy traveling men who
were his fellow passengers.</p>

<p>Wilson's hair ruffled at the
base of his skull, tingling with an
unknown fear that left him shaken.</p>

<p>A voice whispered in his ear:
"Harry Wilson. So you are running
away!"</p>

<p>Just a tiny voice that seemed
hardly a voice at all, it seemed
at once to come from far away
and yet from very near. The
voice, with an edge of coldness on
it, was one he never would forget.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>He cowered in his seat, whimpering.</p>

<p>The voice came again: "Didn't
I tell you that you couldn't run
away? That no matter where you
went, I'd find you?"</p>

<p>"Go away," Wilson whispered
huskily. "Leave me alone. Haven't
you hounded me enough?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the voice, "not
enough. Not yet. You sold us out.
You warned Chambers about our
energy and now Chambers is
sending men to kill us. But they
won't succeed, Wilson."</p>

<p>"You can't hurt me," said Wilson
defiantly. "You can't do anything
but talk to me. You're trying
to drive me mad, but you
can't. I won't let you. I'm not
going to pay any more attention
to you."</p>

<p>The whisper chuckled.</p>

<p>"You can't," argued Wilson
wildly. "All you can do is talk to
me. You've never done anything
but that. You drove me out of
New York and out of London
and now you're driving me out
of Paris. But Berlin is as far as
I will go. I won't listen to you
any more."</p>

<p>"Wilson," whispered the voice,
"look inside your bag. The bag,
Wilson, where you are carrying
that money. That stack of credit
certificates. Almost eleven thousand
dollars, what is left of the
twenty thousand Chambers paid
you."</p>

<p>With a wild cry Wilson clawed
at his bag, snapped it open,
pawed through it.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> credit certificates were
gone!</p>

<p>"You took my money," he
shrieked. "You took everything
I had. I haven't got a cent. Nothing
except a few dollars in my
pocket."</p>

<p>"You haven't got that either,
Wilson," whispered the voice.</p>

<p>There was a sound of ripping
cloth as something like a great,
powerful hand flung aside Wilson's
coat, tore away the inside
pocket. There was a brief flash
of a wallet and a bundle of papers,
which vanished.</p>

<p>The hostess was hurrying toward
him.</p>

<p>"Is there something wrong?"</p>

<p>"They took ..." Wilson began
and stopped.</p>

<p>What could he tell her? Could
he say that a man half way
across the world had robbed him?</p>

<p>The three traveling men were
looking at him.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, miss," he stammered.
"I really am. I fell asleep
and dreamed."</p>

<p>He sat down again, shaken.
Shivering, he huddled back into
the corner of his seat. His hands
explored the torn coat pocket.
He was stranded, high in the air,
somewhere between Paris and
Berlin ... stranded without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
money, without a passport, with
nothing but the clothes he wore
and the few personal effects in
his bag.</p>

<p>Fighting to calm himself, he
tried to reason out his plight. The
plane was entering the Central
European Federation and that,
definitely, was no place to be
without a passport or without visible
means of support. A thousand
possibilities flashed through
his mind. They might think he
was a spy. He might be cited for
illegal entry. He might be framed
by secret police.</p>

<p>Terror perched on his shoulder
and whispered to him. He shivered
violently and drew farther
back into the corner of the seat.
He clasped his hands, beat them
against his huddled knees.</p>

<p>He would cable friends back in
America and have them identify
him and vouch for his character.
He would borrow some money
from them, just enough to get
back to America. But whom
would he cable? And with aching
bitterness in his breast, Harry
Wilson came face to face with
the horrible realization that nowhere
in the world, nowhere in
the Solar System, was there a
single person who was his friend.
There was no one to help him.</p>

<p>He bowed his head in his
hands and sobbed, his shoulders
jerking spasmodically, the sobs
racking his body.</p>

<p>The traveling men stared at
him unable to understand. The
hostess looked briskly helpless.
Wilson knew he looked like a
scared fool and he didn't care.</p>

<p>He <i>was</i> scared.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Gregory Manning</span>
riffled the sheaf of credit
certificates, the wallet, the passport
and pile of other papers that
lay upon the desk in front of him.</p>

<p>"That closes one little incident,"
he said grimly. "That takes
care of our friend Wilson."</p>

<p>"Maybe you were a bit too
harsh with him, Greg," suggested
Russell Page.</p>

<p>Greg shook his head. "He was
a traitor, the lowest thing alive.
He sold the confidence we placed
in him. He traded something that
was not his to trade. He did it
for money and now I've taken
that money from him."</p>

<p>He shoved the pile of certificates
to one side.</p>

<p>"Now I've got this stuff," he
said, "I don't know what to do
with it. We don't want to keep it."</p>

<p>"Why not send it to Chambers?"
suggested Russ. "He will find the
passport and the money on his
desk in the morning. Give him
something to think about tomorrow."</p>

<hr class="tb" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>CHAPTER TWELVE</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Scorio</span> snarled at the four
men: "I want you to get the
thing done right. I don't want
bungling. Understand?"</p>

<p>The bulky, flat-faced man with
the scar across his cheek shuffled
uneasily. "We went over it a dozen
times. We know just what to
do."</p>

<p>He grinned at Scorio, but the
grin was lopsided, more like a
sneering grimace. At one time
the man had failed to side-step
a heat ray and it had left a neat
red line drawn across the right
cheek, nipped the end of the ear.</p>

<p>"All right, Pete," said Scorio,
glaring at the man, "your job is
the heavy work, so just keep your
mind on it. You've got the two
heaters and the kit."</p>

<p>Pete grinned lopsidedly again.
"Yeah, my own kit. I can open
anything hollow with this rig."</p>

<p>"You got a real job tonight,"
snarled Scorio. "Two doors and
a safe. Sure you can do it?"</p>

<p>"Just leave it to me," Pete
growled.</p>

<p>"Chizzy, you're to pilot," Scorio
snapped. "Know the coordinates?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Chizzy, "know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
them by heart. Do it with my
eyes shut."</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes open. We
can't have anything go wrong.
This is too important. You swoop
in at top speed and land on the
roof. Stand by the controls and
keep a hand on the big heater
just in case of trouble. Pete, Max
and Reg will go to the lockdoor.
Reg will stay there with the buzzer
and three drums of ammunition."</p>

<p>He whirled on Reg. "You got
that ammunition?"</p>

<p>Reg nodded emphatically.
"Four drums of it," he said. "One
solid round in the gun. Another
drum of solid and two explosive."</p>

<p>"There's a thousand rounds in
each drum," snapped Scorio, "but
they last only a minute, so do
your firing in bursts."</p>

<p>"I ain't handled buzzers all
these years without knowing
something about them."</p>

<p>"There's only two men there,"
said Scorio, "and they'll probably
be asleep. Come down with your
motor dead. The lab roof is thick
and the plane landing on those
thick tires won't wake them. But
be on your guard all the time.
Pete and Max will go through
the lockdoor into the laboratory
and open the safe. Dump all the
papers and money and whatever
else you find into the bags and
then get out fast. Hop into the
plane and take off. When you're
clear of the building, turn the
heaters on it. I want it melted
down and the men and stuff inside
with it. Don't leave even a
button unmelted. Get it?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Sure</span>, chief," said Pete. He
dusted his hands together.</p>

<p>"Now get going. Beat it."</p>

<p>The four men turned and filed
out of the room, through the door
leading to the tumbledown warehouse
where was hidden the
streamlined metal ship. Swiftly
they entered it and the ship
nosed gently upward, blasting out
through a broken, frameless skylight,
climbing up and up, over
the gleaming spires of New York.</p>

<p>Back in the room hung with
steel-cloth curtains, alone, Scorio
lit a cigarette and chuckled. "They
won't have a chance," he said.</p>

<p>"Who won't?" asked a tiny
voice from almost in front of him.</p>

<p>"Why, Manning and Page ..."
said Scorio, and then stopped.
The fire of the match burned
down and scorched his fingers.
He dropped it. "Who asked that?"
he roared.</p>

<p>"I did," said the piping voice.</p>

<p>Scorio looked down. A three-inch
man sat on a matchbox on
the desk!</p>

<p>"Who are you?" the gangster
shouted.</p>

<p>"I'm Manning," said the little
man. "The one you're going to
kill. Don't you remember?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Damn you!" shrieked Scorio.
His hand flipped open a drawer
and pulled out a flame pistol. The
muzzle of the pistol came up and
blasted. Screwed down to its
smallest diameter, the gun's aim
was deadly. A straight lance of
flame, no bigger than a pencil,
streamed out, engulfed the little
man, bored into the table top.
The box of matches exploded
with a gush of red that was a dull
flash against the blue blaze of
the gun.</p>

<p>But the figure of the man stood
<i>within the flame</i>! Stood there and
waved an arm at Scorio. The piping
voice came out of the heart
of the gun's breath.</p>

<p>"Maybe I'd better get a bit
smaller. Make me harder to hit.
More sport that way."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Scorio's</span> finger lifted from the
trigger. The flame snapped off.
Laboriously climbing out of the
still smoking furrow left in the
oaken table top was Greg Manning,
not more than an inch tall
now.</p>

<p>The gangster laid the gun on
the table, stepped closer, warily.
With the palm of a mighty hand
he swatted viciously at the little
figure.</p>

<p>"I got you now!"</p>

<p>But the figure seemed to ooze
upright between his fingers, calmly
stepped off his hand onto the
table. And now it began to grow.
Watching it, Scorio saw it grow
to six inches and there it stopped.</p>

<p>"What are you?" he breathed.</p>

<p>"I told you," said the little
image. "I'm Gregory Manning.
The man you set out to kill. I've
watched every move you've made
and known everything you
planned."</p>

<p>"But that isn't possible," protested
Scorio. "You're out on the
West Coast. This is some trick.
I'm just seeing things."</p>

<p>"You aren't seeing anything
imaginary. I'm really here, in
this room with you. I could lift
my finger and kill you if I wished ...
and maybe I should."</p>

<p>Scorio stepped back a pace.</p>

<p>"But I'm not going to," said
Manning. "I have something better
saved for you. Something
more appropriate."</p>

<p>"You can't touch me!"</p>

<p>"Look," said Manning sternly.
He pointed his finger at a chair.
It suddenly grew cloudy, became
a wisp of trailing smoke, was
gone.</p>

<p>The gangster backed away,
eyes glued to the spot where the
chair had vanished.</p>

<p>"Look here," piped the little
voice. Scorio jerked his head
around and looked.</p>

<p>The chair was in Manning's
hand. A tiny chair, but the very
one that had disappeared from
the room a moment before.</p>

<p>"Watch out!" warned Manning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and heaved the chair. The tiny
chair seemed to float in the air.
Then with a rush it gathered
speed, grew larger. In a split second
it was a full-sized chair
and it was hurtling straight at
the gangster's head.</p>

<p>With a strangled cry Scorio
threw up his arms. The chair
crashed into him, bowled him
over.</p>

<p>"Now do you believe me?" demanded
Manning.</p>

<p>Scrambling to his feet, Scorio
gibbered madly, for the six-inch
figure was growing. He became
as large as the average man, and
then much larger. His head
cleared the high ceiling by scant
inches. His mighty hands reached
out for the gangster.</p>

<p>Scorio scuttled away on hands
and knees, yelping with terror.</p>

<p>Powerful hands seemed to
seize and lift him. The room was
blotted out. The Earth was gone.
He was in a place where there
was nothing. No light, no heat, no
gravitation. For one searing,
blasting second he seemed to be
floating in strangely suspended
animation. Then with a jolt he
became aware of new surroundings.</p>

<p>He blinked his eyes and looked
around. He was in a great laboratory
that hummed faintly with
the suggestion of terrific power,
that smelled of ozone and seemed
filled with gigantic apparatus.</p>

<p>Two men stood in front of him.</p>

<p>He staggered back.</p>

<p>"Manning!" he gasped.</p>

<p>Manning grinned savagely at
him. "Sit down, Scorio. You won't
have long to wait. Your boys will
be along any minute now."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Chizzy</span> crouched over the
controls, his eyes on the navigation
chart. Only the thin
screech of parted air disturbed
the silence of the ship. The high
scream and the slow, precise
snack-snack of cards as Reg and
Max played a game of double
solitaire with a cold, emotionless
precision.</p>

<p>The plane was near the stratosphere,
well off the traveled air
lanes. It was running without
lights, but the cabin bulbs were
on, carefully shielded.</p>

<p>Pete sat in the co-pilot's chair
beside Chizzy. His blank, expressionless
eyes stared straight
ahead.</p>

<p>"I don't like this job," he complained.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Chizzy.</p>

<p>"Page and Manning aren't the
kind of guys a fellow had ought
to be fooling around with. They
ain't just chumps. You fool with
characters like them and you got
trouble."</p>

<p>Chizzy growled at him disgustedly,
bent to his controls.</p>

<p>Straight ahead was a thin sliver
of a dying Moon that gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
barely enough illumination to
make out the great, rugged blocks
of the mountains, like dark, shadowy
brush-strokes on a newly
started canvas.</p>

<p>Pete shuddered. There was
something about the thin, watery
moonlight, and those brush-stroke
hills....</p>

<p>"It seems funny up here," he
said.</p>

<p>"Hell," growled Chizzy, "you're
going soft in your old age."</p>

<p>Silence fell between the two.
The snack-snack of the cards continued.</p>

<p>"You ain't got nothing to be
afraid of," Chizzy told Pete. "This
tub is the safest place in the
world. She's overpowered a dozen
times. She can outfly anything
in the air. She's rayproof and bulletproof
and bombproof. Nothing
can hurt us."</p>

<p>But Pete wasn't listening. "That
moonlight makes a man see
things. Funny things. Like pictures
in the night."</p>

<p>"You're balmy," declared
Chizzy.</p>

<p>Pete started out of his seat.
His voice gurgled in his throat.
He pointed with a shaking finger
out into the night.</p>

<p>"Look!" he yelled "Look!"</p>

<p>Chizzy rose out of his seat ...
and froze in sudden terror.</p>

<p>Straight ahead of the ship,
etched in silvery moon-lines
against the background of the
star-sprinkled sky, was a grim
and terrible face.</p>

<p>It was as big and hard as a
mountain.</p>

<hr class="tb" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> ship was silent now. Even
the whisper of the cards had
stopped. Reg and Max were on
their feet, startled by the cries of
Pete and Chizzy.</p>

<p>"It's Manning!" shrieked Pete.
"He's watching us!"</p>

<p>Chizzy's hand whipped out like
a striking snake toward the controls
and, as he grasped them,
his face went deathly white. For
the controls were locked! They
resisted all the strength he threw
against them and the ship still
bore on toward that mocking face
that hung above the Earth.</p>

<p>"Do something!" screamed
Max. "You damn fool, do something!"</p>

<p>"I can't," moaned Chizzy. "The
ship is out of control."</p>

<p>It seemed impossible. That
ship was fast and tricky and it
had reserve power far beyond
any possible need. It handled like
a dream ... it was tops in aircraft.
But there was no doubt
that some force more powerful
than the engines and controls of
the ship itself had taken over.</p>

<p>"Manning's got us!" squealed
Pete. "We came out to get him
and now he has us instead!"</p>

<p>The craft was gaining speed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
The whining shriek of the air
against its plates grew thinner
and higher. Listening, one could
almost feel and hear the sucking
of the mighty power that pulled
it at an ever greater pace through
the tenuous atmosphere.</p>

<p>The face was gone from the
sky now. Only the Moon remained,
the Moon and the brush-stroke
mountains far below.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, the speed was
slowing and the ship glided
downward, down into the saw-teeth
of the mountains.</p>

<p>"We're falling!" yelled Max,
and Chizzy growled at him.</p>

<p>But they weren't falling. The
ship leveled off and floated, suspended
above a sprawling laboratory
upon a mountain top.</p>

<p>"That's Manning's laboratory,"
whispered Pete in terror-stricken
tones.</p>

<p>The levers yielded unexpectedly.
Chizzy flung the power control
over, drove the power of the
accumulator bank, all the reserve,
into the engines. The ship lurched,
but did not move. The engines
whined and screamed in torture.
The cabin's interior was filled
with a blast of heat, the choking
odor of smoke and hot rubber.
The heavy girders of the frame
creaked under the mighty forward
thrust of the engines ...
but the ship stood still, frozen
above that laboratory in the hills.</p>

<p>Chizzy, hauling back the lever,
turned around, pale. His hand
began clawing for his heat gun.
Then he staggered back. For there
were only two men in the cabin
with him&mdash;Reg and Max. Pete
had gone!</p>

<p>"He just disappeared," Max
jabbered. "He was standing there
in front of us. Then all at once
he seemed to fade, as if he was
turning into smoke. Then he was
gone."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Something</span> had descended
about Pete. There was no
sound, no light, no heat. He had
no sense of weight. It was as if,
suddenly, his mind had become
disembodied.</p>

<p>Seeing and hearing and awareness
came back to him as one
might turn on a light. From the
blackness and the eventless existence
of a split second before,
he was catapulted into a world
of light and sound.</p>

<p>It was a world that hummed
with power, that was ablaze with
light, a laboratory that seemed
crammed with mighty banks of
massive machinery, lighted by
great globes of creamy brightness,
shedding an illumination
white as sunlight, yet shadowless
as the light of a cloudy day.</p>

<p>Two men stood in front of him,
looking at him, one with a faint
smile on his lips, the other with
lines of fear etched across his
face. The smiling one was Gregory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Manning and the one who
was afraid was Scorio!</p>

<p>With a start, Pete snatched his
pistol from its holster. The sights
came up and lined on Manning
as he pressed the trigger. But the
lancing heat that sprang from
the muzzle of the gun never
reached Manning. It seemed to
strike an obstruction less than a
foot away. It mushroomed with
a flare of scorching radiance that
drove needles of agony into the
gangster's body.</p>

<p>His finger released its pressure
and the gun dangled limply from
his hand. He moaned with the
pain of burns upon his unprotected
face and hands. He beat
feebly at tiny, licking blazes that
ran along his clothing.</p>

<p>Manning was still smiling at
him.</p>

<p>"You can't reach me, Pete," he
said. "You can only hurt yourself.
You're enclosed within a solid
wall of force that matter cannot
penetrate."</p>

<p>A voice came from one corner
of the room: "I'll bring Chizzy
down next."</p>

<p>Pete whirled around and saw
Russell Page for the first time.
The scientist sat in front of a
great control board, his swift,
skillful fingers playing over the
banks of keys, his eyes watching
the instrument and the screen
that slanted upward from the
control banks.</p>

<p>Pete felt dizzy as he stared
at the screen. He could see the
interior of the ship he had been
yanked from a moment before.
He could see his three companions,
talking excitedly, frightened
by his disappearance.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">His</span> eyes flicked away from the
screen, looked up through
the skylight above him. Outlined
against the sky hung the ship.
At the nose and stern, two hemispheres
of blue-white radiance
fitted over the metal framework,
like the jaws of a powerful vise,
holding the craft immovable.</p>

<p>His gaze went back to the
screen again, just in time to see
Chizzy disappear. It was as if the
man had been a mere figure
chalked upon a board ... and
then someone had taken a sponge
and wiped him out.</p>

<p>Russ's fingers were flying over
the keys. His thumb reached out
and tripped a lever. There was
a slight hum of power.</p>

<p>And Chizzy stood beside him.</p>

<p>Chizzy did not pull his gun. He
whimpered and cowered within
the invisible cradle of force.</p>

<p>"You're yellow," Pete snarled
at him, but Chizzy only covered
his eyes with his arms.</p>

<p>"Look, boss," said Pete, addressing
Scorio, "what are you
doing here? We left you back in
New York."</p>

<p>Scorio did not answer. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
merely glared. Pete lapsed into
silence, watching.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Manning</span> stood poised before
the captives, rocking
back and forth on his heels.</p>

<p>"A nice bag for one evening,"
he told Russ.</p>

<p>Russ grinned and stoked up
his pipe.</p>

<p>Manning turned to the gangster
chief. "What do you think
we ought to do with these fellows?
We can't leave them in
those force shells too long because
they'll die for lack of air.
And we can't let them loose because
they might use their guns
on us."</p>

<p>"Listen, Manning," Scorio
rasped hoarsely, "just name your
price to let us loose. We'll do
anything you want."</p>

<p>Manning drew his mouth down.
"I can't think of a thing. We just
don't seem to have any use for
you."</p>

<p>"Then what in hell," the gangster
asked shakily, "are you going
to do with us?"</p>

<p>"You know," said Manning, "I
may be a bit old-fashioned along
some lines. Maybe I am. I just
don't like the idea of killing
people for money. I don't like
people stealing things other
people have worked hard to get.
I don't like thieves and murderers
and thugs corrupting city
governments, taking tribute on
every man, woman and child in
our big cities."</p>

<p>"But look here, Manning,"
pleaded Scorio, "we'd be good
citizens if we just had a chance."</p>

<p>Manning's face hardened. "You
sent these men here to kill us
tonight, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly. Stutsman
kind of wanted you killed, but
I told the boys just to get the
stuff in the safe and never mind
killing you. I said to them that
you were pretty good eggs and
I didn't like to bump you off,
see?"</p>

<p>"I see," said Manning.</p>

<p>He turned his back on Scorio
and started to walk away. The
gangster chief came half-way out
of his chair, and as he did so,
Russ reached out a single finger
and tapped a key. Scorio screamed
and beat with his fists against
the wall of force that had suddenly
formed about him. That
single tap on the great keyboard
had sprung a trap, had been the
one factor necessary to bring into
being a force shell already spun
and waiting for him.</p>

<p>Manning did not even turn
around at Scorio's scream. He
slowly paced his way down the
line of standing gangsters. He
stopped in front of Pete and
looked at him.</p>

<p>"Pete," he said, "you've sprung
a good many prisons, haven't
you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"There ain't a jug in the System
that can hold me," Pete
boasted, "and that's a fact."</p>

<p>"I believe there's one that
could," Greg told him. "One that
no man has ever escaped from,
or ever will."</p>

<p>"What's that?" demanded Pete.</p>

<p>"The Vulcan Fleet," said Greg.</p>

<p>Pete looked into the eyes of
the man before him and read the
purpose in those eyes. "Don't
send me there! Send me any
place but there!"</p>

<p>Greg turned to Russ and nodded.
Russ's fingers played their
tune of doom upon the keyboard.
His thumb depressed a lever.
With a roar five gigantic material
energy engines screamed with
thrumming power.</p>

<p>Pete disappeared.</p>

<p>The engines roared with thunderous
throats, a roar that seemed
to drown the laboratory in solid
waves of sound. A curious refractive
effect developed about
the straining hulks as space near
them bent under their lashing
power.</p>

<p>Months ago Russ and Greg
had learned a better way of
transmitting power than by metal
bars or through conducting
beams. Beams of such power as
were developing now would have
smashed atoms to protons and
electrons. Through a window in
the side of the near engine, Greg
could see the iron ingot used as
fuel dwindling under the sucking
force.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> droning died and only a
hum remained.</p>

<p>"He's in a prison now he'll
never get out of," said Greg
calmly. "I wonder what they'll
think when they find him, dressed
in civilian clothes and carrying
a heat gun. They'll clap him into
a photo-cell and keep him there
until they investigate. When they
find out who he is, he won't get
out&mdash;he has enough unfinished
prison sentences to last a century
or two."</p>

<p>For Pete was on one of the
Vulcan Fleet ships, the hell-ships
of the prison fleet. There were
confined only the most vicious
and the most depraved of the
Solar System's criminals. He
would be forced to work under
the flaming whip-lashes of a Sun
that hurled such intense radiations
that mere spacesuits were
no protection at all. The workers
on the Vulcan Fleet ships wore
suits that were in reality photo-cells
which converted the deadly
radiations into electric power.
For electric power can be disposed
of where heat cannot.</p>

<p>Quailing inside his force shell,
Scorio saw his men go, one by
one. Saw them lifted and whisked
away, out through the depths of
space by the magic touch upon
the keyboards. With terror-widened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
eyes he watched Russ set
up the equations, saw him trip
the activating lever, saw the men
disappear, listened to the thunderous
rumbling of the mighty
engines.</p>

<p>Chizzy went to the Outpost,
the harsh prison on Neptune's
satellite. Reg went to Titan, clear
across the Solar System, where
men in the infamous penal colony
labored in the frigid wastes of
that moon of Saturn. Max went
to Vesta, the asteroid prison,
which long had been the target
of reformers, who claimed that
on it 50 per cent of the prisoners
died of boredom and fear.</p>

<p>Max was gone and only Scorio
remained.</p>

<p>"Stutsman's the one who got
us into this," wailed the gangster.
"He's the man you want to get.
Not me. Not the boys. Stutsman."</p>

<p>"I promise you," said Greg,
"that we'll take care of Stutsman."</p>

<p>"And Chambers, too," chattered
Scorio. "But you can't
touch Chambers. You wouldn't
dare."</p>

<p>"We're not worrying about
Chambers," Greg told him. "We're
not worrying about anyone.
You're the one who had better
start doing some."</p>

<p>Scorio cringed.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you about a place
on Venus," said Greg. "It's in the
center of a big swamp that
stretches for hundreds of miles
in every direction. It's a sort of
mountain rising out of the swamp.
And the swamp is filled with
beasts and reptiles of every kind.
Ravenous things, lusting for
blood. But they don't climb the
mountain. A man, if he stayed on
the mountain, would be safe.
There's food there. Roots and berries
and fruits and even small
animals one could kill. A man
might go hungry for a while, but
soon he'd find the things to eat.</p>

<p>"But he'd be alone. No one
ever goes near that mountain. I
am the only man who ever set
foot on it. Perhaps no one ever
will again. At night you hear the
screaming and the crying of the
things down in swamp, but you
mustn't pay any attention to
them."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Scorio's</span> eyes widened, staring.
"You won't send me <i>there</i>!"</p>

<p>"You'll find my campfires,"
Greg told him, "if the rain hasn't
washed them away. It rains a lot.
So much and so drearily that
you'll want to leave that mountain
and walk down into the
swamp, of your own free will, and
let the monsters finish you."</p>

<p>Scorio sat dully. He did not
move. Horror glazed his eyes.</p>

<p>Greg signed to Russ. Russ, pipe
clenched between his teeth,
reached out his fingers for the
keys. The engines droned.</p>

<p>Manning walked slowly to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
television control, sat down in the
chair and flipped over a lever. A
face stared out of the screen. It
was strangely filled with anger
and a sort of half-fear.</p>

<p>"You watched it, didn't you,
Stutsman?" Greg asked.</p>

<p>Stutsman nodded. "I watched.
You can't get away with it, Manning.
You can't take the law into
your own hands that way."</p>

<p>"You and Chambers have been
taking the law into your hands
for years," said Greg. "All I did
tonight was clear the Earth of
some vermin. Every one of those
men was guilty of murder ... and
worse."</p>

<p>"What did you gain by it?"
asked Stutsman.</p>

<p>Greg gave a bitter laugh. "I
convinced you, Stutsman," he
said, "that it isn't so easy to kill
me. I think it'll be some time before
you try again. Better luck
next time."</p>

<p>He flipped the switch and
turned about in the chair.</p>

<p>Russ jerked his thumb at the
skylight. "Might as well finish the
ship now."</p>

<p>Greg nodded.</p>

<p>An instant later there was a
fierce, intolerably blue-white light
that lit the mountains for many
miles. For just an instant it flared,
exploding into millions of brilliant,
harmless sparks that died
into darkness before they touched
the ground. The gangster ship
was destroyed beyond all tracing,
disintegrated. The metal and
quartz of which it was made were
simply gone.</p>

<p>Russ brought his glance back
from the skylight, looked at his
friend. "Stutsman will do everything
he can to wipe us out. By
tomorrow morning the Interplanetary
machine will be rolling.
With only one purpose&mdash;to crush
us."</p>

<p>"That's right," Greg agreed,
"but we're ready for them now.
Our ship left the Belgium factories
several hours ago. The
<i>Comet</i> towed it out in space and
it's waiting for us now. In a few
hours the <i>Comet</i> will be here to
pick us up."</p>

<p>"War in space," said Russ, musingly.
"That's what it will be."</p>

<p>"Chambers and his gang won't
fight according to any rules.
There'll be no holds barred, no
more feeble attempts like the one
they tried tonight. From now on
we need a base that simply can't
be located."</p>

<p>"The ship," said Russ.</p>

<hr class="tb" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> <i>Invincible</i> hung in space,
an empty, airless hull, the
largest thing afloat.</p>

<p>Chartered freighters, leaving
their ports from distant parts of
the Earth, had converged upon
her hours before, had unloaded
crated apparatus, storing it in
the yawning hull. Then they had
departed.</p>

<p>Now the sturdy little space-yacht,
<i>Comet</i>, was towing the
great ship out into space, 500,000
miles beyond the orbit of the
Moon. Slowly the hull was being
taken farther and farther away
from possible discovery.</p>

<p>Work on the installation of the
apparatus had started almost as
soon as the <i>Comet</i> had first
tugged at the ponderous mass.
Leaving only a skeleton crew in
charge of the <i>Comet</i>, the rest of
the selected crew had begun the
assembly of the mighty machines
which would transform the <i>Invincible</i>
into a thing of unimaginable
power and speed.</p>

<p>The doors were closed and
sealed and the air, already stored
in the ship's tanks, was released.
The slight acceleration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
<i>Comet's</i> towing served to create
artificial weight for easier work,
but not enough to handicap the
shifting of the heavier pieces of
apparatus. An electric cable was
run back from the little yacht
and the <i>Invincible</i> took her first
breath of life.</p>

<p>The work advanced rapidly,
for every man was more than a
mere engineer or spacebuster.
They were a selected crew, the
men who had helped to make the
name of Gregory Manning famous
throughout the Solar System.</p>

<p>First the engines were installed,
then the two groups of five massive
power plants and the single
smaller engine as an auxiliary supply
plant for the light, heat, air.</p>

<p>The accumulators of the <i>Comet</i>
were drained in a single tremendous
surge and the auxiliary generator
started. It in turn awoke
to life the other power plants, to
leave them sleeping, idling, but
ready for instant use to develop
power such as man never before
had dreamed of holding and
molding to his will.</p>

<p>Then, with the gigantic tools
these engines supplied ... tools
of pure force and strange space
fields ... the work was rapidly
completed. The power boards
were set in place, welded in position
by a sudden furious blast
of white hot metal and as equally
sudden freezing, to be followed
by careful heating and recooling
till the beryl-steel reached its
maximum strength. Over the hull
swarmed spacesuited men, using
that strange new power, heat-treating
the stubborn metal in a
manner never before possible.</p>

<p>The generators were charging
the atoms of the ship's beryl-steel
hide with the same hazy
force that had trapped and held
the gangster ship in a mighty
vise. Thus charged, no material
thing could penetrate them. The
greatest meteor would be crushed
to drifting dust without so much
as scarring that wall of mighty
force ... meteors traveling with
a speed and penetrative power
that no gun-hurled projectile
could ever hope to attain.</p>

<p>Riding under her own power,
driven by the concentration of
gravitational lines, impregnable
to all known forces, containing
within her hull the secrets of
many strange devices, the <i>Invincible</i>
wheeled in space.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Russell Page</span> lounged in a
chair before the control manual
of the tele-transport machine.
He puffed placidly at his pipe
and looked out through the great
sweep of the vision panel. Out
there was the black of space and
the glint of stars, the soft glow
of distant Jupiter.</p>

<p>Greg Manning was hunched
over the navigation controls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
sharp eyes watching the panorama
of space.</p>

<p>Russ looked at him and
grinned. On Greg's face there
was a smile, but about his eyes
were lines of alert watchfulness
and thought. Greg Manning was
in his proper role at the controls
of a ship such as the <i>Invincible</i>,
a man who never stepped backward
from danger, whose spirit
hungered for the vast stretches
of void that lay between the
worlds.</p>

<p>Russ leaned back, blowing
smoke toward the high-arched
control room ceiling.</p>

<p>They had burned their bridges
behind them. The laboratory
back in the mountains was destroyed.
Locked against any possible
attack by a sphere of force
until the tele-transport had lifted
from it certain items of equipment,
it had been melted into a
mass of molten metal that formed
a pool upon the mountain top,
that ran in gushing, fiery ribbons
down the mountain side, flowing
in gleaming curtains over precipices.
It would have been easier
to have merely disintegrated in
one bursting flash of energy, but
that would have torn apart the
entire mountain range, overwhelmed
and toppled cities hundreds
of miles away, dealt Earth
a staggering blow.</p>

<p>A skeleton crew had taken the
<i>Comet</i> back to Earth and landed
it on Greg's estate. Once again
the tele-transport had reached
out, wrapped its fingers around
the men who stepped from the
little ship. In less than the flash
of a strobe light, they had been
snatched back to the <i>Invincible</i>,
through a million miles of space,
through the very walls of the
ship itself. One second they had
been on Earth, the next second
they were in the control room
of the <i>Invincible</i>, grinning, saluting
Greg Manning, trotting back
to their quarters in the engine
rooms.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Russ</span> stared out at space,
puffed at his pipe, considering.</p>

<p>A thousand years ago men had
held what they called tournaments.
Armored knights rode out
into the jousting grounds and
broke their lances to prove which
was the better man. Today there
was to be another tournament.
This ship was to be their charger,
and the gauntlet had been flung
to Spencer Chambers and Interplanetary
Power. And all of
space was to be the jousting
grounds.</p>

<p>This was war. War without
trappings, without fanfare, but
bitter war upon which depended
the future of the Solar System.
A war to break the grip of steel
that Interplanetary accumulators
had gained upon the planets,
to shatter the grim dream of empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
held by one man, a war for
the right to give to the people of
the worlds a source of power that
would forever unshackle them.</p>

<p>Back in those days, a thousand
years ago, men had built a system
of government that historians
called the feudal system. By
this system certain men were
called lords or barons and other
titles. They held the power of
life and death over the men
"under" them.</p>

<p>This was what Spencer Chambers
was trying to do with the
Solar System ... what he would
do if someone did not stop him.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Russ</span> bit viciously on his pipe-stem.</p>

<p>The Earth, the Solar System,
never could revert to that ancient
way of government. The proud
people spawned on the Earth,
swarming outward to the other
planets, must never have to bow
their heads as minions to an
overlord.</p>

<p>The thrum of power was beating
in his brain, the droning,
humming power from the engine
rooms that would blast, once and
forever, the last threat of dictatorship
upon any world. The
power that would free a people,
that would help them on and up
and outward to the great destiny
that was theirs.</p>

<p>And this had come because,
wondering, groping, curiously, he
had sought to heat a slender
thread of imperm wire within
Force Field 348, because another
man had listened and had made
available his fortune to continue
the experiments. Blind luck and
human curiosity ... perhaps
even the madness of a human
dream ... and from those things
had come this great ship, this
mighty power, these many bulking
pieces of equipment that
would perform wonders never
guessed at less than a year ago.</p>

<p>Greg Manning swiveled his
chair. "Well, Russ, we're ready
to begin. Let's get Wrail first."</p>

<p>Russ nodded silently, his mind
still half full of fleeting thought.
Absent-mindedly he knocked out
his pipe and pocketed it, swung
around to the manual of the
televisor. His fingers reached out
and tapped a pattern.</p>

<p>Callisto appeared within the
screen, leaped upward at them.
Then the surface of the frozen
little world seemed to rotate
swiftly and a dome appeared.</p>

<p>The televisor dived through
the dome, sped through the city,
straight for a penthouse apartment.</p>

<p>Ben Wrail sat slumped in a
chair. A newspaper was crumpled
at his feet. In his lap lay a mangled
dead cigar.</p>

<p>"Greg!" yelled Russ. "Greg,
there's something wrong!"</p>

<p>Greg leaped forward, stared at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the screen. Russ heard his
smothered cry of rage.</p>

<p>In Wrail's forehead was a tiny,
neatly drilled hole from which a
single drop of blood oozed.</p>

<p>"Murdered!" exclaimed Russ.</p>

<p>"Yes, murdered," said Greg,
and there was a sudden calmness
in his voice.</p>

<p>Russ grasped the televisor control.
Ranthoor's streets ran beneath
them, curiously silent and
deserted. Here and there lay
bodies. A few shop windows were
smashed. But the only living that
stirred was a dog that slunk
across the street and into the
shadows of an alley.</p>

<p>Swiftly the televisor swung
along the streets. Straight into
the screen clanked a marching
detail of government police, herding
before them a half dozen
prisoners. The men had their
hands bound behind their backs,
but they walked with heads held
high.</p>

<p>"Revolution," gasped Russ.</p>

<p>"Not a revolution. A purge.
Stutsman is clearing the city of
all who might be dangerous to
him. This will be happening on
every other planet where Chambers
holds control."</p>

<p>Perspiration ran down Russ's
forehead and dripped into his
eyes as he manipulated the controls.</p>

<p>"Stutsman is striking first," said
Greg, calmly ... far too calmly.
"He's consolidating his position,
possibly on the pretense that
plots have been discovered."</p>

<p>A few buildings were bombed.
A line of bodies were crumpled
at the foot of a steel wall, marking
the spot where men had been
lined up and mowed down with
one sweeping blast from a heater.</p>

<p>Russ turned the television controls.
"Let's see about Venus and
Mars."</p>

<p>The scenes in Ranthoor were
duplicated in Sandebar on Mars,
in New Chicago, the capital of
Venus. Everywhere Stutsman
had struck ... everywhere the
purge was wiping out in blood
every person who might revolt
against the Chambers-dictated
governments. Throughout the
Solar System violence was on
the march, iron-shod boots trampling
the rights of free men to
tighten the grip of Interplanetary.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> the control room of the
<i>Invincible</i> the two men stared
at one another.</p>

<p>"There's one man we need,"
said Greg. "One man, if he's still
alive, and I think he is."</p>

<p>"Who is that?" asked Russ.</p>

<p>"John Moore Mallory," said
Greg.</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He was imprisoned
in Ranthoor, but Stutsman transferred
him some place else. Possibly
to one of the prison fleet."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"If we had the records of the
Callisto prison," suggested Russ,
"we could find out."</p>

<p>"If we had the records ..."</p>

<p>"We'll get them!" Russ said.</p>

<p>He swung back to the keyboard
again.</p>

<p>A moment later the administration
offices of the prison were
on the screen.</p>

<p>The two men searched the vision
plate.</p>

<p>"The records are most likely
in that vault," said Russ. "And
the vault is locked."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about the lock,"
snapped Greg. "Just bring the
whole damn thing here&mdash;vault
and records and all."</p>

<p>Russ nodded grimly. His
thumb tripped the tele-transport
control and from the engine
rooms came a drone of power. In
Ranthoor Prison, great bands of
force wrapped themselves around
the vault, clutching it, enfolding
it within a sphere of power. Back
in the <i>Invincible</i> the engines
screamed and the vault was
ripped out of the solid steel wall
as easily as a man might rip a
button from his shirt.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">John Moore Mallory</span>
sat on the single metal chair
within his cell and pressed his
face against the tiny vision port.
For hours he had sat there, staring
out into the blackness of
space.</p>

<p>There was bitterness in John
Moore Mallory's soul, a terrible
and futile bitterness. So long as
he had remained within the
Ranthoor prison, there had always
been a chance of escape.
But now, aboard the penal ship,
there was no hope. Nothing but
the taunting reaches of space,
the mocking pinpoints of the
stars, the hooting laughter of the
engines.</p>

<p>Sometimes he had thought he
would go mad. The everlasting
routine, the meaningless march
of hours. The work period, the
sleep period ... the work period,
the sleep period ... endless monotony,
an existence without a
purpose. Men buried alive in
space.</p>

<p>"John Moore Mallory," said a
voice.</p>

<p>Mallory heard, but he did not
stir. An awful thought crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
his mind. Now he was hearing
voices calling his name!</p>

<p>"John Mallory," said the voice
again.</p>

<p>Mallory slowly turned about
and as he turned he started from
his chair.</p>

<p>A man stood in the cell! A
man he had never seen before,
who had come silently, for there
had been no screech of opening
door.</p>

<p>"You are John Moore Mallory,
aren't you?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am Mallory. Who are
you?"</p>

<p>"Gregory Manning."</p>

<p>"Gregory Manning," said Mallory
wonderingly. "I've heard of
you. You're the man who rescued
the Pluto Expedition. But why
are you here? How did you get
in?"</p>

<p>"I came to take you away
with me," said Greg. "Back to
Callisto. Back to any place you
want to go."</p>

<p>Mallory flattened himself
against the partition, his face
white with disbelief. "But I'm in
a prison ship. I'm not free to go
and come as I please."</p>

<p>Greg chuckled. "You are free
to go and come as you please
from now on," he said. "Even
prison ships can't hold you."</p>

<p>"You're mad," whispered
Mallory. "Either you're mad or
I am. You're a dream. I'll wake
up and find you gone."</p>

<p>Manning stood in silence, looking
at the man. Mallory bore the
marks of prison on him. His eyes
were haunted and his rugged
face was pinched and thin.</p>

<p>"Listen closely, Mallory," said
Greg softly. "You aren't going
mad and I'm not mad. You aren't
seeing things. You aren't hearing
things. You're actually talking to
me."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">There</span> was no change in the
other's face.</p>

<p>"Mallory," Greg went on, "I
have what you've always needed&mdash;means
of generating almost unlimited
energy at almost no cost,
the secret of the energy of matter.
A secret that will smash Interplanetary,
that will free the
Solar System from Spencer
Chambers. But I can't make that
secret available to the people until
Chambers is crushed, until
I'm sure that he can't take it
from me. And to do that I need
your help."</p>

<p>Mallory's face lost its expression
of bewilderment, suddenly
lighted with realization. But his
voice was harsh and bitter.</p>

<p>"You came too late. I can't
help you. Remember, I'm in a
prison ship from which no one
can escape. You have to do what
you can ... you must do what
you can. But I can't be with you."</p>

<p>Manning strode forward. "You
don't get the idea at all. I said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
I'd get you out of here and I'm
going to. I could pick up this ship
and put it wherever I wanted.
But I don't want to. I just want
you."</p>

<p>Mallory stared at him.</p>

<p>"Just don't be startled," said
Greg. "Something will happen
soon. Get ready for it."</p>

<p>Feet drummed on the metal
corridor outside.</p>

<p>"Hey, you, pipe down!" yelled
the voice of the guard. "You know
there's no talking allowed now.
Go to sleep."</p>

<p>"That's the guard," Mallory
whispered fiercely. "They'll stop
us."</p>

<p>Greg grinned viciously. "No,
they won't."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> guard came into view
through the grilled door.</p>

<p>"So it's you, Mallory ..." he
began, stopping in amazement.
"Hey, you!" he shouted at Greg.
"Who are you? How did you get
in that cell?"</p>

<p>Greg flipped a hand in greeting.
"Pleasant evening, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The guard grabbed for the
door, but he did not reach the
bars. Some force stopped him
six inches away. It could not be
seen, could not be felt, but his
straining against it accomplished
nothing.</p>

<p>"Mallory and I are leaving,"
Greg told the guard. "We don't
like it here. Too stuffy."</p>

<p>The guard lifted a whistle and
blew a blast. Feet pounded outside.
A prisoner yelled from one
of the cells. Another catcalled.
Instantly the ship was in an uproar.
The convicts took up the
yammering, shaking the bars on
their doors.</p>

<p>"Let's get started," Greg said
to Mallory. "Hold tight."</p>

<p>Blackness engulfed Mallory.
He felt a peculiar twisting
wrench. And then he was standing
in the control room of a ship
and Gregory Manning and another
man were smiling at him.
White light poured down from a
cluster of globes. Somewhere in
the ship engines purred with the
hum of power. The air was fresh
and pure, making him realize
how foul and stale the air of the
prison ship had been.</p>

<p>Greg held out his hand. "Welcome
to our ship."</p>

<p>Mallory gripped his hand,
blinking in the light. "Where am
I?"</p>

<p>"You are on the <i>Invincible</i>,
five million miles off Callisto."</p>

<p>"But were you here all the
time?" asked Mallory. "Were you
in my cell back there or weren't
you?"</p>

<p>"I was really in your cell,"
Greg assured him. "I could have
just thrown my image there, but
I went there personally to get
you. Russ Page, here, sent me
out. When I gave him the signal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
he brought both of us back."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're with us," Russ
said. "Perhaps you'd like a cup
of coffee, something to eat."</p>

<p>Mallory stammered. "Why, I
really would." He laughed. "Rations
weren't too good in the
prison ship."</p>

<p>They sat down while Russ
rang the galley for coffee and
sandwiches.</p>

<p>Crisply, Greg informed Mallory
of the situation.</p>

<p>"We want to start manufacturing
these engines as soon as possible,"
he explained, "but I
haven't even dared to patent
them. Chambers would simply
buy out the officials if I tried it
on Earth, delay the patent for a
few days and then send through
papers copied from ours. You
know what he'd do with it if he
got the patent rights. He'd scrap
it and the old accumulator business
would go on as always. If
I tried it on any other world,
with any other government, he'd
see that laws were passed to
block us. He'd probably instruct
the courts to rule against the
manufacture of the engines on
the grounds that they were dangerous."</p>

<p>Mallory's face was grave.
"There's only one answer," he
said. "With the situation on the
worlds, with this purge you told
me about, there's only one thing
to do. We have to act at once.
Every minute we wait gives
Stutsman just that much longer
to tighten his hold."</p>

<p>"And that answer?" asked
Russ.</p>

<p>"Revolution," said Mallory.
"Simultaneous revolution in the
Jovian confederacy, on Mars and
Venus. Once free, the planets
will stay free with your material
energy engines. Spencer Chambers
and his idea of Solar
System domination will be too
late."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Greg's</span> forehead was wrinkled
in thought, his facial muscles
tensed.</p>

<p>"First thing to do," he said,
"is to contact all the men we can
find ... men we can rely on to
help us carry out our plans. We'll
need more televisor machines,
more teleport machines, some for
use on Mars and Venus, others
for the Jovian moons. We will
have to bring the men here to
learn to operate them. It'll take a
few days. We'll get some men to
work on new machines right
away."</p>

<p>He started to rise from his
chair, but at that moment the
coffee and sandwiches arrived.</p>

<p>Greg grinned. "We may as well
eat first."</p>

<p>Mallory looked grateful and
tried to keep from wolfing the
food. The others pretended not
to notice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Grim</span> hours followed, an unrelenting
search over two
planets and four moons for men
whom Mallory considered loyal
to his cause&mdash;men willing to risk
their lives to throw off the yoke
of Interplanetary.</p>

<p>They were hard to find. Many
of them were dead, victims of
the purge. The others were in
hiding and word of them was
difficult to get.</p>

<p>But slowly, one by one, they
were ferreted out, the plan explained
to them, and then, by
means of the tele-transport, they
were brought to the <i>Invincible</i>.</p>

<p>Hour after hour men worked,
stripped to their waists, in the
glaring inferno of terrible force
fields, fashioning new television
units. As fast as the sets were
constructed, they were placed in
operation.</p>

<p>The work went faster than
could be expected, yet it was
maddeningly slow.</p>

<p>For with the passing of each
hour, Stutsman clamped tighter
his iron grip on the planets. Concentration
camps were filled to
overflowing. Buildings were
bombed and burned. Murders
and executions were becoming
too common to be news.</p>

<p>Then suddenly there was a
new development.</p>

<p>"Greg, Craven has found something!"
Russ cried. "I can't get
him!"</p>

<p>Supervising the installation of
a new televisor set, Greg spun
around. "What's that?"</p>

<p>"Craven! I can't reach him.
He's blocking me out!"</p>

<p>Greg helped, but the apparatus
was unable to enter the Interplanetary
building in New York.
Certain other portions of the city
adjacent to the building also were
blanketed out. In all the Solar
System, the Interplanetary building
was the only place they
could not enter, except the Sun
itself.</p>

<p>Craven had developed a field
from which their field shied off.
The televisor seemed to roll off
it like a drop of mercury. That
definitely ended all spying on
Craven and Chambers.</p>

<p>Russ mopped his brow, sucked
at his dead pipe.</p>

<p>"Light penetrates it," he said.
"Matter penetrates it, electricity,
all ordinary forces. But this field
won't. It's ... well, whatever Craven
has is similarly dissimilar.
The same thing of opposite nature.
It repels our field, but
doesn't affect anything else. That
means he has analyzed our fields.
We have Wilson to thank for
this."</p>

<p>Greg nodded gravely. "There's
just one thing to be thankful
for," he declared. "He probably
isn't any nearer our energy than
he was before. But now we can't
watch him. And that field of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
shows that he has tremendous
power of some sort."</p>

<p>"We can't watch him, but we
can follow him," corrected Russ.
"He can't shake us. None of them
can. The mechanical shadow will
take care of that. I have one for
Craven with a bit of 'bait' off his
spectacles and he'll keep those
spectacles, never fear. He's blind
as a bat without them. And we
can track Chambers with his
ring."</p>

<p>"That's right," agreed Greg,
"but we've got to speed up. Craven
is getting under way now.
If he does this, he can do something
else. Something that will
really hurt us. The man's clever ...
too damn clever."</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;miracle</span> came to pass in
Ranthoor when a man for
whom all hope had been abandoned
suddenly appeared within
the city's streets. But he appeared
to be something not quite earthly,
for he did not have the solidity
of a man. He was pale, like a
wraith from out of space, and
one could see straight through
him, yet he still had all the old
mannerisms and tricks.</p>

<p>In frightened, awe-stricken
whispers the word was spread ...
the spirit of John Moore Mallory
had come back to the city once
again. He bulked four times the
height of a normal man and
there was that singular ghostliness
about him. From where he
had come, or how, or why, no
one seemed to know.</p>

<p>But when he reached the steps
of the federation's administration
building and walked straight
through a line of troopers that
suddenly massed to bar his way,
and when he turned on those
steps and spoke to the people
who had gathered, there was
none to doubt that at last a sign
had come. The sign that now, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
ever, was the time to avenge the
purge. Now the time to take vengeance
for the blood that flowed
in gutters, for the throaty chortling
of the flame guns that had
snuffed out lives against a broad
steel wall.</p>

<p>Standing on the steps, shadowy
but plainly visible, John
Moore Mallory talked to the
people in the square below, and
his voice was the voice they remembered.
They saw him toss
his black mane of hair, they saw
his clenched fist raised in terrible
anger, they heard the boom
of the words he spoke.</p>

<p>Like a shrilling alarm the
words spread through the city,
reverberating from the dome,
seeking out those who were in
hiding. From every corner of the
city, from its deepest cellars and
its darkest alleys, poured out a
mass of humanity that surrounded
the capitol and blackened the
square and the converging streets
with a mob that shrieked its hatred,
bellowed its anger.</p>

<p>"Power!" thundered the mighty
shadow on the steps. "Power to
burn! Power to give away. Power
to heat the dome, to work your
mines, to drive your spaceships!"</p>

<p>"Power!" answered the voice
of the crowd. "Power!" It sounded
like a battle cry.</p>

<p>"No more accumulators,"
roared the towering image.
"Never again need you rely on
Spencer Chambers for your power.
Callisto is yours. Ranthoor is
yours."</p>

<p>The black crowd surged forward,
reached the steps and
started to climb, wild cheers in
their throat, the madness of victory
in their eyes. Up the steps
came men with nothing but bare
hands, screaming women, jeering
children.</p>

<p>Officers snapped orders at the
troops that lined the steps, but
the troopers, staring into the awful,
raging maw of that oncoming
crowd, dropped their guns and
fled, back into the capitol building,
with the mob behind them,
shrilling blood lust and long-awaited
vengeance.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Out</span> of the red and yellow
wilderness of the deserts, a
man came to Sandebar on Mars.
He had long been thought dead.
The minions of the government
had announced that he was dead.
But he had been in hiding for six
years.</p>

<p>His beard was long and gray,
his eyes were curtained by hardship,
his white hair hung about
his shoulders and he was clothed
in the tattered leather trappings
of the spaceways.</p>

<p>But men remembered him.</p>

<p>Tom Brown had lead the last
revolt against the Martian government,
an ill-starred revolt that
ended almost before it started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
when the troopers turned loose
the heavy heaters and swept the
streets with washing waves of
flame.</p>

<p>When he climbed to the base
of a statue in Techor Park to
address the crowd that gathered,
the police shouted for him to
come down and he disregarded
them. They climbed the statue
to reach him and their hands
went through him.</p>

<p>Tom Brown stood before the
people, in plain view, and spoke,
but he wasn't there!</p>

<p>Other things happened in
Sandebar that day. A voice spoke
out of thin air, a voice that told
the people the reign of Interplanetary
was over. It told of a
mighty new source of power.
Power that would cost almost
nothing. Power that would make
the accumulators unnecessary ...
would make them out of date.
A voice that said the people need
no longer submit to the yoke
of Spencer Chambers' government
in order to obtain the power
they needed.</p>

<p>There was no one there ...
no one visible at all. And yet
that voice went on and on. A
great crowd gathered, listening,
cheering. The police tried to
break it up and failed. The
troops were ordered out and the
people fought them until the
voice told them to disband
peaceably and go to their homes.</p>

<p>Throughout Mars it was the
same.</p>

<p>In a dozen places in Sandebar
the voice spoke. It spoke in a
dozen places, out of empty air,
in Malacon and Alexon and Adebron.</p>

<p>Tom Brown, vanishing into
the air after his speech was done,
reappeared a few minutes later
in Adebron and there the police,
warned of what had happened in
Sandebar, opened fire upon him
when he stood on a park bench
to address the people. But the
flames passed through and did
not touch him. Tom Brown, his
long white beard covering his
chest, his mad eyes flashing,
stood in the fiery blast that bellowed
from the muzzles of the
flame rifles and calmly talked.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> chief of police at New
Chicago, Venus, called the
police commissioner. "There's a
guy out here in the park, just
across the street. He's preaching
treason. He's telling the people
to overthrow the government."</p>

<p>In the ground glass the police
commissioner's face grew purple.</p>

<p>"Arrest him," he ordered the
chief. "Clap him in the jug. Do
you have to call me up every
time one of those fiery-eyed boys
climbs a soap box? Run him in."</p>

<p>"I can't," said the chief.</p>

<p>The police commissioner
seemed ready to explode. "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
can't? Why the hell not?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know that hill in
the center of the park? Memorial
Hill?"</p>

<p>"What has a hill got to do with
it?" the commissioner roared.</p>

<p>"He's sitting on top of that hill.
He's a thousand feet tall. His
head is way up in the sky and
his voice is like thunder. How
can you arrest anybody like
that?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Everywhere</span> in the System,
revolt was flaming. New
marching songs rolled out between
the worlds, wild marching
songs that had the note of anger
in them. Weapons were brought
out of hiding and polished. New
standards were raised in an ever-rising
tide against oppression.</p>

<p>Freedom was on the march
again. The right of a man to rule
himself the way he chose to rule.
A new declaration of independence.
A Solar Magna Carta.</p>

<p>There were new leaders, led
by the old leaders. Led by spirits
that marched across the sky. Led
by voices that spoke out of the
air. Led by signs and symbols
and a new-born courage and a
great and a deep conviction that
right in the end would triumph.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Spencer Chambers</span>
glared at Ludwig Stutsman.
"This is one time you went too
far."</p>

<p>"If you'd given me a free hand
before, this wouldn't have been
necessary," Stutsman said. "But
you were soft. You made me go
easy when I should have ground
them down. You left the way
open for all sorts of plots and
schemes and leaders to develop."</p>

<p>The two men faced one another,
one the smooth, tawny
lion, the other the snarling wolf.</p>

<p>"You've built up hatred, Stutsman,"
Chambers said. "You are
the most hated man in the Solar
System. And because of you,
they hate me. That wasn't my
idea. I needed you because I
needed an iron fist, but I needed
it to use judiciously. And you
have been ruthless. You've used
force when conciliation was necessary."</p>

<p>Stutsman sneered openly. "Still
that old dream of a benevolent
dictatorship. Still figuring yourself
a little bronze god to be set
up in every household. A dictatorship
can't be run that way.
You have to let them know
you're boss."</p>

<p>Chambers was calm again.
"Argument won't do us any good
now. The damage is done. Revolt
is flaming through all the worlds.
We have to do something."</p>

<p>He looked at Craven, who was
slouched in a chair beside the
desk across which he and Stutsman
faced each other.</p>

<p>"Can you help us, doctor?" he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
asked.</p>

<p>Craven shrugged. "Perhaps,"
he said acidly. "If I could only
be left to my work undisturbed,
instead of being dragged into
these stupid conferences, I might
be able to do something."</p>

<p>"You already have, haven't
you?" asked Chambers.</p>

<p>"Very little. I've been able to
blank out the televisor that Manning
and Page are using, but
that is all."</p>

<p>"Do you have any idea where
Manning and Page are?"</p>

<p>"How could I know?" Craven
asked. "Somewhere in space."</p>

<p>"They're at the bottom of
this," snarled Stutsman. "Their
damned tricks and propaganda."</p>

<p>"We know they're at the bottom
of it," said Craven. "That's
no news to us. If it weren't for
them, we wouldn't have this
trouble now, despite your bungling.
But that doesn't help us
any. With this new discovery of
mine I have shielded this building
from their observation. They
can't spy on us any more. But
that's as far as I've got."</p>

<p>"They televised the secret
meeting of the emergency council
when it met in Satellite City
on Ganymede the other day,"
said Chambers. "The whole Jovian
confederacy watched and
listened to that meeting, heard
our secret war plans, for fully
ten minutes before the trick was
discovered. Couldn't we use your
shield to prevent such a situation
again?"</p>

<p>"Better still," suggested Stutsman,
"let's shield the whole satellite.
Without Manning's ghostly
leaders, this revolt would collapse
of its own weight."</p>

<p>Craven shook his head. "It
takes fifty tons of accumulators
to build up that field, and a ton
of fuel a day to maintain it. Just
for this building alone. It would
be impossible to shield a whole
planet, an entire moon."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Any</span> progress on your collector
field?" asked Chambers.</p>

<p>"Some," Craven admitted. "I'll
know in a day or two."</p>

<p>"That would give us something
with which to fight Manning
and Page, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Craven. "It
would be something to fight
them with. If I can develop that
collector field, we would be able
to utilize every radiation in
space, from the heat wave down
through the cosmics. Within the
Solar System, our power would
be absolutely limitless. Your accumulators
depend for their power
storage upon just one radiation ...
heat. But with this idea
I have you'd use all types of
radiations."</p>

<p>"You say you could even put
the cosmics to work?" asked
Chambers.</p>

<p>Craven nodded. "If I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
can do anything at all with the
field, I can."</p>

<p>"How?" demanded Stutsman.</p>

<p>"By breaking them up, you
fool. Smash the short, high-powered
waves into a lot of longer,
lower-powered waves." Craven
swung back to face Chambers.
"But don't count on it," he
warned. "I haven't done it yet."</p>

<p>"You have to do it," Chambers
insisted.</p>

<p>Craven rose from his chair,
his blue eyes blazing angrily behind
the heavy lenses. "How
often must I tell you that you
cannot hurry scientific investigation?
You have to try and try ...
follow one tiny clue to another
tiny clue. You have to be patient.
You have to hope. But you cannot
force the work."</p>

<p>He strode from the room,
slammed the door behind him.</p>

<p>Chambers turned slowly in his
chair to face Stutsman. His gray
eyes bored into the wolfish face.</p>

<p>"And now," he suggested, "suppose
you tell me just why you
did it."</p>

<p>Stutsman's lips curled. "I suppose
you would rather I had allowed
those troublemakers to go
ahead, consolidate their plans.
There was only one thing to do&mdash;root
them out, liquidate them.
I did it."</p>

<p>"You chose a poor time," said
Chambers softly. "You would
have to do something like this,
just at the time when Manning
is lurking around the Solar System
somewhere, carrying enough
power to wipe us off the face of
the Earth if he wanted to."</p>

<p>"That's why I did it," protested
Stutsman. "I knew Manning was
around. I was afraid he'd start
something, so I beat him to it.
I thought it would throw a scare
into the people, make them afraid
to follow Manning when he acted."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"You</span> have a low opinion of
the human race, don't you?"
Chambers said. "You think you
can beat them into a mire of
helplessness and fear."</p>

<p>Chambers rose from his chair,
pounded his desk for emphasis.</p>

<p>"But you can't do it, Stutsman.
Men have tried it before
you, from the very dawn of history.
You can destroy their
homes and kill their children.
You can burn them at the stake
or in the electric chair, hang
them or space-walk them or herd
them into gas chambers. You can
drive them like cattle into concentration
camps, you can keep
the torture racks bloody, but you
can't break them.</p>

<p>"Because the people always
survive. Their courage is greater
than the courage of any one man
or group of men. They always
reach the man who has oppressed
them, they always tear him down
from the place he sits, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
do not deal gently with him
when they do. In the end the
people always win."</p>

<p>Chambers reached across the
desk and caught Stutsman by
the slack of the shirt. A twist of
his hand tightened the fabric
around Stutsman's neck. The
financier thrust his face close to
the wolfish scowl. "That is what
is going to happen to you and
me. We'll go down in history as
just a couple of damn fools who
tried to rule and couldn't make
the grade. Thanks to you and
your damned stupidity. You and
your blood purges!"</p>

<p>Patches of anger burned on
Stutsman's cheeks. His eyes glittered
and his lips were white.
But his whisper was bitter mockery.
"Maybe we should have
coddled and humored them.
Made them just so awful happy
that big bad old Interplanetary
had them. So they could have
set up little bronze images of
you in their homes. So you could
have been sort of a solar god!"</p>

<p>"I still think it would have
been the better way." Chambers
flung Stutsman from him with a
straight-armed push. The man
reeled and staggered across the
carpeted floor. "Get out of my
sight!"</p>

<p>Stutsman straightened his
shirt, turned and left.</p>

<p>Chambers slumped into his
chair, his hands grasping the
arms on either side of his great
body, his eyes staring out
through the window from which
flooded the last rays of the afternoon
Sun.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Drums</span> pounded in his brain ...
the drums of rebellion out in
space, of rebellion on those other
worlds ... drums that were
drowning out and shattering forever
the dream that he had woven.
He had wanted economic
dictatorship ... not the cold,
passionless, terrible dictatorship
that Stutsman typified ... but one
that would bring peace and prosperity
and happiness to the Solar
System.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and thought.
Snatches of ambition, snatches of
hopes ... but it was useless to
think, for the drums and the
imagined shouting drowned out
his thoughts.</p>

<p>Mankind didn't give a damn
for good business administration,
nor a hoot for prosperity or
peace or happiness. Liberty and
the right to rule, the right to go
risk one's neck ... to climb a
mountain or cross a desert or explore
a swamp, the right to aim
one's sights at distant stars, to
fling a taunting challenge into
the teeth of space, to probe with
clumsy fingers and force nature
to lay bare her secrets ... that
was what mankind wanted. That
was what those men out on Mars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and Venus and in the Jovian
worlds were fighting for. Not
against Spencer Chambers or
Ludwig Stutsman or Interplanetary
Power, but for the thing that
drove man on and made of him
a flame that others might follow.
Fighting for a heritage that was
first expressed when the first man
growled at the entrance to his
cave and dared the world to take
it from him.</p>

<p>Spencer Chambers closed his
eyes and rocked back and forth
in the tilting office chair.</p>

<p>It had been a good fight, a
hard fight. He had had a lot of
fun out of it. But he was licked,
after all these years. He had held
the biggest dream of any man
who ever lived. Alexander and
Napoleon, Hitler, Stalin and
those other fellows had been
pikers alongside of Spencer
Chambers. They had only aimed
at Earthly conquest while he had
reached out to grab at all the
worlds. But by heaven, he'd almost
made it!</p>

<p>A door grated open.</p>

<p>"Chambers!" said a voice.</p>

<p>His feet hit the floor with a
thud and he sat stiff and staring
at the figure in the door.</p>

<p>It was Craven and the man
was excited. His glasses were slid
far down on his nose, his hair was
standing on end, his tie was all
awry.</p>

<p>"I have it!" Craven whooped.
"I have it at last!"</p>

<p>Hope clutched at Chambers,
but he was almost afraid to
speak.</p>

<p>"Have what?" he whispered
tensely.</p>

<p>"The collector field! It was
under my nose all the time, but
I didn't see it!"</p>

<p>Chambers was out of his chair
and striding across the room. A
tumult buzzed within his skull.</p>

<p>Licked? Hell, he hadn't even
started! He'd win yet. He'd
teach the people to revolt! He'd
run Manning and Page out to
the end of space and push them
through!</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> was a weird revolution.
There were few battles, little
blood shed. There seemed to be
no secret plots. There were no
skulking leaders, no passwords,
nothing that in former years had
marked rebellion against tyranny.</p>

<p>It was a revolution carried out
with utter boldness. Secret police
were helpless, for it was not
a secret revolution. The regular
police and the troopers were
helpless because the men they
wanted to arrest were shadows
that flitter here and there ...
large and substantial shadows,
but impossible to seize and imprison.</p>

<p>Every scheme that was hatched
within the government circles
was known almost at once to the
ghostly leaders who stalked the
land. Police detachments, armed
with warrants for the arrests of
men who had participated in
some action which would stamp
them as active rebels, found the
suspects absent when they broke
down the doors. Someone had
warned them. Troops, hurried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
points where riots had broken
out, arrived to find peaceful
scenes, but with evidence of recent
battle. The rioters had been
warned, had made their getaway.</p>

<p>When the rebels struck it was
always at the most opportune
time, when the government was
off balance or off guard.</p>

<p>In the first day of the revolt,
Ranthoor fell when the maddened
populace, urged on by the
words of a shadowy John Moore
Mallory, charged the federation
buildings. The government fled,
leaving all records behind, to
Satellite City on Ganymede.</p>

<p>In the first week three Martian
cities fell, but Sandebar, the
capital, still held out. On Venus,
Radium City was taken by the
rebels within twenty-four hours
after the first call to revolt had
rung across the worlds, but New
Chicago, the seat of government,
still was in the government's
hands, facing a siege.</p>

<p>Government propagandists
spread the word that the material
energy engines were not safe.
Reports were broadcast that on
at least two occasions the engines
had blown up, killing the
men who operated them.</p>

<p>But this propaganda failed to
gain credence, for in the cities
that were in the rebel hands,
technicians were at work manufacturing
and setting up the material
engines. Demonstrations
were given. The people saw them,
saw what enormous power they
developed.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Russ Page</span> stared incredulously
at the television
screen. It seemed to be shifting
back and forth. One second it
held the distorted view of Satellite
City on Ganymede, and the
next second the view of jumbled,
icy desert somewhere outside the
city.</p>

<p>"Look here, Greg," he said.
"Something's wrong."</p>

<p>Greg Manning turned away
from the calculator where he had
been working and stared at the
screen.</p>

<p>"How long has it been acting
that way?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Just started," said Russ.</p>

<p>Greg straightened and glanced
down the row of television machines.
Some of them were dead,
their switches closed, but on the
screens of many of the others
was the same effect as on this
machine. Their operators were
working frustratedly at the controls,
trying to focus the image,
bring it into sharp relief.</p>

<p>"Can't seem to get a thing,
sir," said one of the men. "I was
working on the fueling station
out on Io, and the screen just
went haywire."</p>

<p>"Mine seems to be all right,"
said another man. "I've had it on
Sandebar for the last couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
hours and there's nothing wrong."</p>

<p>A swift check revealed one
fact. The machines, when trained
on the Jovian worlds, refused to
function. Anywhere else in space,
however, they worked perfectly.</p>

<p>Russ stoked and lit his pipe,
snapped off his machine and
swung around in the operator's
chair.</p>

<p>"Somebody's playing hell with
us out around Jupiter," he stated
calmly.</p>

<p>"I've been expecting something
like this," said Greg. "I have
been afraid of this ever since
Craven blanketed us out of the
Interplanetary building."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"He</span> really must have something
this time," Russ
agreed. "He's blanketing out the
entire Jovian system. There's a
space field of low intensity surrounding
all of Jupiter, enclosing
all the moons. He keeps shifting
the intensity so that, even though
we can force our way through his
field, the irregular variations
make it impossible to line up anything.
It works, in principle, just
as effectively as if we couldn't
get through at all."</p>

<p>Greg whistled soundlessly
through suddenly bared teeth.</p>

<p>"That takes power," he said,
"and I'm afraid Craven has it.
Power to burn."</p>

<p>"The collector field?" asked
Russ.</p>

<p>Greg nodded. "A field that
sucks in radiant energy. Free
energy that he just reaches out
and grabs. And it doesn't depend
on the Sun alone. It probably
makes use of every type of radiation
in all of space."</p>

<p>Russ slumped in his chair,
smoking, his forehead wrinkled
in thought.</p>

<p>"If that's what he's got," he
finally declared, "he's going to
be hard to crack. He can suck
in any radiant vibration form,
any space vibration. He can shift
them around, break them down
and build them up. He can discharge
them, direct them. He's
got a vibration plant that's the
handiest little war machine that
ever existed."</p>

<p>Greg suddenly wheeled and
walked to a wall cabinet. From it
he took a box and, opening it,
lifted out a tiny mechanism.</p>

<p>He chuckled deep in his throat.
"The mechanical shadow. The
little machine that always tells
us where Craven is&mdash;as long as
he's wearing his glasses."</p>

<p>"He always wears them," said
Russ crisply. "He's blind as a bat
without them."</p>

<p>Greg set the machine down on
the table. "When we find Craven,
we'll find the contraption that's
blanketing Jupiter and its
moons."</p>

<p>Dials spun and needles quivered.
Rapidly Russ jotted down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the readings on a sheet of paper.
At the calculator, he tapped keys,
depressed the activator. The
machine hummed and snarled
and chuckled.</p>

<p>Russ glanced at the result imprinted
on the paper roll.</p>

<p>"Craven is out near Jupiter,"
he announced. "About 75,000
miles distant from its surface, in
a plane normal to the Sun's
rays."</p>

<p>"A spaceship," suggested Greg.</p>

<p>Russ nodded. "That's the only
answer."</p>

<p>The two men looked at one
another.</p>

<p>"That's something we can get
hold of," said Greg.</p>

<p>He walked to the ship controls
and lowered himself into
the pilot's chair. A hand came
out and hauled back a lever.</p>

<p>The <i>Invincible</i> moved.</p>

<p>From the engine rooms came
the whine of the gigantic power
plant as it built up and maintained
the gravity concentration
center suddenly created in front
of the ship.</p>

<p>Russ, standing beside Greg at
the control panel, looked out into
space and marveled. They were
flashing through space, their
speed building up at a breath-taking
rate, yet they had no real
propulsion power. The discovery
of the gravity concentrator
had outdated such a method of
driving a spaceship. Instead, they
were falling, hurtling downward
into the yawning maw of an
artificial gravity field. And such
a method made for speed, terrible
speed.</p>

<p>Jupiter seemed to leap at
them. It became a great crimson
and yellow ball that filled almost
half the vision plate.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> <i>Invincible's</i> speed was
slacking off, slower and slower,
until it barely crawled in comparison
to its former speed.</p>

<p>Slowly they circled Jupiter's
great girth, staring out of the vision
port for a sight of Craven's
ship. They were nearing the position
the little mechanical shadow
had indicated.</p>

<p>"There it is," said Russ suddenly,
almost breathlessly.</p>

<p>Far out in space, tiny, almost
like a dust mote against the great
bulk of the monster planet, rode
a tiny light. Slowly the <i>Invincible</i>
crawled inward. The mote of
light became a gleaming silver
ship, a mighty ship&mdash;one that was
fully as large as the <i>Invincible</i>!</p>

<p>"That's it all right," said Greg.
"They're lying behind a log out
here raising hell with our television
apparatus. Maybe we better
tickle them a little bit and
see what they have."</p>

<p>Rising from the control board,
he went to another control panel.
Russ remained standing in front
of the vision plate, staring down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
at the ship out in space.</p>

<p>Behind him came a shrill howl
from the power plant. The <i>Invincible</i>
staggered slightly. A beam
of deep indigo lashed across
space, a finger suddenly jabbing
at the other ship.</p>

<p>Space was suddenly colored,
for thousands of miles, as the
beam struck Craven's ship and
seemed to explode in a blast of
dazzling indigo light. The ship
reeled under the impact of the
blow, reeled and weaved in space
as the beam struck it and delivered
to it the mighty power of the
screaming engines back in the
engine room.</p>

<p>"What happened?" Greg
screamed above the roar.</p>

<p>Russ shrugged his shoulders.
"You jarred him a little. Pushed
him through space for several
hundred miles. Made him know
something had hit him, but it
didn't seem to do any damage."</p>

<p>"That was pure cosmic I gave
him! Five billion horsepower&mdash;and
it just staggered him!"</p>

<p>"He's got a space lens that absorbs
the energy," said Russ.
"The lens concentrates it and
pours it into a receiving chamber,
probably a huge photo-cell.
Nobody yet has burned out one
of those things on a closed circuit."</p>

<p>Greg wrinkled his brow, perplexed.
"What he must have is
a special field of some sort that
lowers the wave-length and the
intensity. He's getting natural
cosmics all the time and taking
care of them."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't be much of a
trick," Russ pointed out. "But
when he takes care of cosmics
backed by five billion horsepower ...
that's something else!"</p>

<p>Greg grinned wickedly. "I'm
going to hand him a long heat
radiation. If his field shortens
that any, he'll have radio beam
and that will blow photo-cells
all to hell."</p>

<p>He stabbed viciously at the
keys on the board and once again
the shrill howl of the engines
came from the rear of the ship.
A lance of red splashed out
across space and touched the
other ship. Again space was lit,
this time with a crimson glow.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Russ</span> shook his head. "Nothing
doing."</p>

<p>Greg sat down and looked at
Russ. "Funny thing about this.
They just sat there and let us
throw two charges at them, took
everything we gave them and
never tried to hand it back."</p>

<p>"Maybe they haven't anything
to hand us," Russ suggested hopefully.</p>

<p>"They must have. Craven
wouldn't take to space with just
a purely defensive weapon. He
knew we'd find him and he'd
have a fight on his hands."</p>

<p>Russ found his pipe was dead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Snapping his lighter, he applied
flame to the blackened tobacco.
Walking slowly to the wall cabinet,
he lifted two other boxes
out, set them on the table and
took from them two other mechanical
shadows. He turned them
on and leaned close, watching
the spinning dials, the quivering
needles.</p>

<p>"Greg," he whispered, "Chambers
and Stutsman are there in
that ship with Craven! Look,
their shadows register identical
with the one that spotted Craven."</p>

<p>"I suspected as much," Greg
replied. "We got the whole pack
cornered out here. If we can just
get rid of them, the whole war
would be won in one stroke."</p>

<p>Russ lifted a stricken face
from the row of tiny mechanisms.
"This is our big chance. We may
never get it again. The next hour
could decide who is going to
win."</p>

<p>Greg rose from the chair and
stood before the control board.
Grimly he punched a series of
keys. The engines howled again.
Greg twisted a dial and the howl
rose into a shrill scream.</p>

<p>From the <i>Invincible</i> another
beam lashed out ... another and
another. Space was speared with
beam after beam hurtling from
the great ship.</p>

<p>Swiftly the beams went
through the range of radiation,
through radio and short radio,
infra-red, visible light, ultra-violet,
X-ray, the gammas and the
cosmics&mdash;a terrific flood of billions
of horsepower.</p>

<p>Craven's ship buckled and
careened under the lashing impacts
of the bombardment, but it
seemed unhurt!</p>

<p>Greg's face was bleaker than
usual as he turned from the
board to look at Russ.</p>

<p>"We've used everything we
have," he said, "and he's stopped
them all. We can't touch him."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Russ</span> shivered. The control
room suddenly seemed chilly
with a frightening kind of cold.</p>

<p>"He's carrying photo-cells and
several thousand tons of accumulator
stacks. Not much power
left in them. He could pour a
billion horsepower into them for
hours and still have room for
more."</p>

<p>Greg nodded wearily. "All
we've been doing is feeding him."</p>

<p>The engines were humming
quietly now, singing the low song
of power held in leash.</p>

<p>But then they screamed like
a buzz saw biting into an iron-hard
stick of white oak.
Screamed in a single, frightful
agony as they threw into the protecting
wall that enclosed the <i>Invincible</i>
all the power they could develop.</p>

<p>The air of the ship was instantaneously
charged with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
hazy, bluish glow, and the sharp,
stinging odor of ozone filled the
ship.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Outside</span>, an enormous burst
of blue-white flame splashed
and spattered around the <i>Invincible</i>.
Living lightning played in
solid, snapping sheets around the
vision port and ran in trickling
blazing fire across the plates.</p>

<p>Russ cried out and backed
away, holding his arm before his
eyes. It was as if he had looked
into a nova of energy exploding
before his eyes.</p>

<p>In the instant the scream died
and the splash of terrific fire had
vanished. Only a rapidly dying
glow remained.</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Russ
dazedly. "What happened? Ten
engines every one of them capable
of over five billion horsepower
and every one of them
screaming!"</p>

<p>"Craven," said Greg grimly.
"He let us have everything he
had. He simply drained his accumulator
stacks and threw it
all into our face. But he's done
now. That was his only shot. He'll
have to build up power now and
that will take a while. But we
couldn't have taken much more."</p>

<p>"Stalemate," said Russ. "We
can't hurt him, he can't hurt us."</p>

<p>"Not by a damn sight," declared
Greg. "I still have a trick
or two in mind."</p>

<p>He tried them. From the <i>Invincible</i>
a fifty-billion-horsepower
bolt of living light and fire sprang
out as all ten engines thundered
with an insane voice that racked
the ship.</p>

<p>Fireworks exploded in space
when the bolt struck Craven's
ship. Screen after screen exploded
in glittering, flaming sparks,
but the ship rode the lashing
charge, finally halted the thrust
of power. The beam glowed faintly,
died out.</p>

<p>Perspiration streamed down
Greg's face as he bent over a calculator
and constructed the formula
for a magnetic field. He
sent out a field of such unimaginable
intensity that it would
have drawn any beryl-steel within
a mile of it into a hard, compact
mass. Even the <i>Invincible</i>,
a hundred miles away, lurched
under the strain. But Craven's
ship, after the first wild jerk, did
not move. A curious soft glow
spread out from the ship, veered
sharply and disappeared in the
magnetic field.</p>

<p>Greg swore softly. "He's cutting
it down as fast as I try to
build it up," he explained, "and
I can't move it any nearer."</p>

<p>From Craven's ship lashed out
another thunderbolt and once
again the engines screamed in
terrible unison as they poured
power into the ship's triple
screen. The first screen stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
all material things. The second
stopped radiations by refracting
them into the fourth dimension.
The third shield was akin to the
anti-entropy field, which stopped
all matter ... and yet the ten
engines bellowed like things insane
as Craven struck with flaming
bolts, utilizing the power he
had absorbed from the fifty billion
horsepower Greg had thrown
at him.</p>

<p>There was anger in Greg Manning's
face ... a terrible anger.
His fists knotted and he shook
them at the gleaming ship that
lay far down near Jupiter.</p>

<p>"I've got one trick left," he
shouted, almost as if he expected
Craven to hear. "Just one trick.
Damn you, see if you can stop
this one!"</p>

<p>He set up the pattern on the
board and punched the activating
lever. The ten engines
thrummed with power. Then the
howling died away.</p>

<p>Four times they screamed and
four times they ebbed into a
gentle hum.</p>

<p>"Get on the navigation controls!"
yelled Greg. "Be ready to
give the ship all you've got."</p>

<p>Greg leaped for the control
chair, grasped the acceleration
lever.</p>

<p>"Now," growled Greg, "look
out, Craven, we're coming at
you!"</p>

<p>Greg, teeth gritted, slammed
the acceleration over.</p>

<p>Suddenly all space wrenched
horribly with a nauseating, terrible
thud that seemed to strain
at the very anchors of the Universe.</p>

<hr class="tb" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Jupiter</span> and the Jovian
worlds leaped suddenly backward,
turned swiftly green, then
blue, and faded in an instant into
violet. The Sun spun crazily
through space, retreating, dimming
to a tiny ruby-tinted star.</p>

<p>The giant generators in the
<i>Invincible</i> hummed louder now,
continually louder, a steel-throated
roar that trembled through
every plate, through every girder,
through every bit of metal in
the ship.</p>

<p>The ship itself was plunging
spaceward, streaking like a runaway
star for the depths of space
beyond the Solar System. And
behind it, caught tight, gripped
and held, Craven's ship trailed
at the end of a tractor field that
bound it to the space-rocketing
<i>Invincible</i>.</p>

<p>The acceleration compensator,
functioning perfectly, had taken
up the slack as the ship had
plunged from a standing start into
a speed that neared the pace
of light. But it had never been
built to stand such sudden, intense
acceleration, and for an instant
Russ and Greg seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
be crushed by a mighty weight
that struck at them. The sensation
swiftly lifted as the compensator
took up the load.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Greg</span> shook his head, flinging
the trickling perspiration
from his eyes.</p>

<p>"I hope their compensator
worked as well as ours," he said.</p>

<p>"If it didn't," declared Russ,
"we're towing a shipload of dead
men."</p>

<p>Russ glanced at the speed dial.
They were almost touching the
speed of light. "He hasn't cut
down our speed yet."</p>

<p>"We threw him off his balance.
His drive depends largely on the
mass of some planet as a body to
take up the reaction of his ship.
Jupiter is the ideal body for that ... but
he's leaving Jupiter behind.
He has to do something
soon or it'll be too late."</p>

<p>"He's getting less energy, too,"
said Russ. "We're retreating from
his main sources of energy, the
Sun and Jupiter. Almost the
speed of light and that would
cut down his energy intake terrifically.
He has to use what he's
got in his accumulators, and after
that last blast at us, they must be
nearly drained."</p>

<p>As Russ watched, the speed
needle fell off slightly. Russ held
his breath. It edged back slowly,
creeping. The speed was being
cut down.</p>

<p>"Craven is using whatever
power he has," he said. "They're
alive back there, all right. He's
trying to catch hold of Jupiter
and make its gravity work for
him."</p>

<p>The <i>Invincible</i> felt the strain
of the other ship now. Felt it as
Craven poured power into his
drive, fighting to get free of the
invisible hawser that had trapped
him, fighting against being
dragged into outer space at the
tail-end of a mighty craft heading
spaceward with frightening
speed.</p>

<p>Girders groaned in the <i>Invincible</i>,
the engines moaned and
throbbed. The speed needle fell
back, creeping down the dial,
slowly, unwillingly, resisting any
drop in speed. But Craven was
cutting it down. And as he cut
it, he was able to absorb more
energy with his collector lens.
But he was fighting two things ...
momentum and the steadily
decreasing gravitational pull of
Jupiter and the Sun. The Sun's
pull was dwindling slowly, Jupiter's
rapidly.</p>

<p>The needle still crept downward.</p>

<p>"What's his point of equality
to us?" demanded Greg. "Will we
make it?"</p>

<p>Russ shook his head. "Won't
know for hours. He'll be able to
slow us up ... maybe he'll even
stop us or be able to jerk free,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
although I doubt that. But every
minute takes him farther away
from his main source of power,
the Solar System's radiation. He
could collect power anywhere in
space, you know, but the best
place to collect it is near large
radiant bodies."</p>

<p>Russ continued to crouch over
the dial, begrudging every backward
flicker of the needle.</p>

<p>This was the last play, the final
hand. If they could drag Craven
and his ship away from the Solar
System, maroon him deep in
space, far removed from any
source of radiation, they would
win, for they could go back and
finish the work of smashing Interplanetary.</p>

<p>But if Craven won&mdash;if he could
halt their mad dash for space, if
he could shake free&mdash;they'd never
have another chance. He would
be studying that field they had
wrapped around him, be ready
for it next time, might even develop
one like it and use it on
the <i>Invincible</i>. If Craven could
win his way back to the Sun, he
would be stronger than they
were, could top them in power,
shatter all their plans, and once
again the worlds would bow to
Interplanetary and Spencer
Chambers.</p>

<p>Russ watched the meter. The
speed was little more than ten
miles a second now and dropping
rapidly. He sat motionless,
hunched, sucking at his dead
pipe, listening to the thrumming
of the generators.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"If</span> we only had a margin," he
groaned. "If we just had a
few more horsepower. Just a few.
But we're wide open. Every engine
is developing everything it can!"</p>

<p>Greg tapped him on the shoulder,
gently. Russ turned his head
and looked into the face of his
friend, a face as bleak as ever,
but with a hint of smile in the
corners of the eyes.</p>

<p>"Why not let Jupiter help us?"
he asked. "He could be a lot of
help."</p>

<p>Russ stared for a moment, uncomprehending.
Then with a sob
of gladness he reached out a
hand, shoved over a lever. Mirrors
of anti-entropy shifted, assumed
different angles, and the
<i>Invincible</i> sheered off. They were
no longer retreating directly from
the Sun, but at an angle quartering
off across the Solar System.</p>

<p>Greg grinned. "We're falling
behind Jupiter now. Letting Jupiter
run away from us as he circles
his orbit, following the Sun. Adds
miles per second to our velocity
of retreat, even if it doesn't show
on the dial."</p>

<p>The cosmic tug of war went
on, grimly&mdash;two ships straining,
fighting each other, one seeking
to escape, the other straining to
snake the second ship into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
maw of open, hostile space.</p>

<p>The speed was down to five
miles a second, then a fraction
lower. The needle was flickering
now, impossible to decide whether
it was dropping or not. And in
the engine rooms, ten great generators
howled in their attempt
to make that needle move up the
dial again.</p>

<p>Russ lit his pipe, his eyes not
leaving the dial. The needle was
creeping lower again. Down to
three miles a second now.</p>

<p>He puffed clouds of smoke and
considered. Saturn fortunately
was ninety degrees around in his
orbit. On the present course, only
Neptune remained between them
and free space. Pluto was far
away, but even if it had been, it
really wouldn't count, for it was
small and had little attraction.</p>

<p>In a short while Ganymede
and Callisto would be moving
around on the far side of Jupiter
and that might help. Everything
counted so much now.</p>

<p>The dial was down to two
miles a second and there it hung.
Hung and stayed. Russ watched
it with narrowed eyes. By this
time Craven certainly would
have given up much hope of help
from Jupiter. If the big planet
couldn't have helped him before,
it certainly couldn't now. In another
hour or two Earth would
transit the Sun and that would
cut down the radiant energy to
some degree. But in the meantime
Craven was loading his photo-cells
and accumulators, was
laying up a power reserve. As a
last desperate resort he would
use that power, in a final attempt
to break away from the <i>Invincible</i>.</p>

<p>Russ waited for that attempt.
There was nothing that could be
done about it. The engines were
developing every watt of power
that could be urged out of them.
If Craven had the power to break
away, he would break away ... that
was all there would be to it.</p>

<p>An hour passed and the needle
crept up a fraction of a point.
Russ was still watching the dial,
his mind foggy with concentration.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Suddenly</span> the <i>Invincible</i>
shuddered and seemed to totter
in space, as if something, some
mighty force, had struck the ship
a terrific blow. The needle swung
swiftly backward, reached one
mile a second, dipped to half a
mile.</p>

<p>Russ sat bolt upright, holding
his breath, his teeth clenched with
death grip upon the pipe-stem.</p>

<p>Craven had blasted with everything
he had! He had used every
last trickle of power in the accumulators ...
all the power he
had been storing up.</p>

<p>Russ leaped from the chair
and raced to the periscopic mirror.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Stooping, he stared into it.
Far back in space, like a silver
bauble, swung Craven's ship. It
swung back and forth in space,
like a mighty, cosmic pendulum.
Breathlessly he watched. The
ship was still in the grip of the
space field!</p>

<p>"Greg," he shouted, "we've got
him!"</p>

<p>He raced back to the control
panel, snapped a glance at the
speed dial. The needle was rising
rapidly now, a full mile a second.
Within another fifteen minutes,
it had climbed to a mile and a
half. The <i>Invincible</i> was starting
to go places!</p>

<p>The engines still howled,
straining, shrieking, roaring their
defiance.</p>

<p>In an hour the needle indicated
the speed of four miles a
second. Two hours later it was
ten and rising visibly as Jupiter
fell far behind and the Sun became
little more than a glowing
cinder.</p>

<p>Russ swung the controls to
provide side acceleration and the
two ships swung far to the rear
of Neptune. They would pass
that massive planet at the safe
distance of a full hundred million
miles.</p>

<p>"He won't even make a pass
at it," said Greg. "He knows he's
licked."</p>

<p>"Probably trying to store some
more power," suggested Russ.</p>

<p>"Sweet chance he has to do
that," declared Greg. "Look at
that needle walk, will you? We'll
hit the speed of light in a few
more hours and after that he
may just as well shut off his
lens. There just won't be any
radiation for him to catch."</p>

<p>Craven didn't make a try at
Neptune. The planet was far
away when they intersected its
orbit ... furthermore, a wall of
darkness had closed in about the
ships. They were going three
times as fast as light and the
speed was still accelerating!</p>

<p>Hour after hour, day after day,
the <i>Invincible</i> and its trailing
captive sped doggedly outward
into space. Out into the absolute
wastes of interstellar space,
where the stars were flecks of
light, like tiny eyes watching
from very far away.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Russ</span> lounged in the control
chair and stared out the vision
plate. There was nothing to
see, nothing to do. There hadn't
been anything to see or do for
days. The controls were locked
at maximum and the engines
still hammered their roaring song
of speed and power. Before them
stretched an empty gulf that
probably never before had been
traversed by any intelligence,
certainly not by man.</p>

<p>Out into the mystery of interstellar
space. Only it didn't seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
mysterious. It was very commonplace
and ordinary, almost monotonous.
Russ gripped his pipe
and chuckled.</p>

<p>There had been a day when
men had maintained one couldn't
go faster than light. Also, men
had claimed that it would be impossible
to force nature to give
up the secret of material energy.
But here they were, speeding
along faster than light, their engines
roaring with the power of
material energy.</p>

<p>They were plowing a new
space road, staking out a new
path across the deserts of space,
pioneering far beyond the 'last
frontier.'</p>

<p>Greg's steps sounded across
the room. "We've gone a long
way, Russ. Maybe we better begin
to slow down a bit."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Russ. He leaned
forward and grasped the controls.
"We'll slow down now," he said.</p>

<p>Sudden silence smote the ship.
Their ears, accustomed for days
to the throaty roarings of the
engines, rang with the torture of
no sound.</p>

<p>Long minutes and then new
sounds began to be heard ... the
soft humming of the single engine
that provided power for the
interior apparatus and the maintenance
of the outer screens.</p>

<p>"Soon as we slow down below
the speed of light," said Greg,
"we'll throw the televisor on
Craven's ship and learn what
we can about his apparatus. No
use trying it now, for we couldn't
use it, because we're in the same
space condition it uses in normal
operation."</p>

<p>"In fact," laughed Russ, "we
can't do much of anything except
move. Energies simply can't
pass through this space we're in.
We're marooned."</p>

<p>Greg sat down in a chair,
gazed solemnly at Russ.</p>

<p>"Just what was our top speed?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>Russ grinned. "Ten thousand
times the speed of light," he said.</p>

<p>Greg whistled soundlessly. "A
long way from home."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Far</span> away, the stars were tiny
pinpoints, like little crystals
shining by the reflection of a
light. Pinpoints of light and
shimmering masses of lacy silver ...
star dust that seemed ghostly
and strange, but was in reality
the massing of many million
mighty stars. And great empty
black spaces where there was
not a single light, where the dark
went on and on and did not stop.</p>

<p>Greg exhaled his breath softly.
"Well, we're here."</p>

<p>"Wherever that might be,"
amended Russ.</p>

<p>There were no familiar constellations,
not a single familiar
star. Every sign post of the space
they had known was wiped out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"There really aren't any brilliant
stars," said Russ. "None at
all. We must be in a sort of hole
in space, a place that's relatively
empty of any stars."</p>

<p>Greg nodded soberly. "Good
thing we have those mechanical
shadows. Without them we'd
never find our way back home.
But we have several that will
lead us back."</p>

<p>Outside the vision panel, they
could see Craven's ship. Freed
now of the space field, it was
floating slowly, still under the
grip of the momentum they had
built up in their dash across
space. It was so close that they
could see the lettering across its
bow.</p>

<p>"So they call it the <i>Interplanetarian</i>,"
said Russ.</p>

<p>Greg nodded. "Guess it's about
time we talk to them. I'm afraid
they're getting pretty nervous."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Do</span> you have any idea where
we are?" demanded Ludwig
Stutsman.</p>

<p>Craven shook his head. "No
more idea than you have. Manning
snaked us across billions of
miles, clear out of the Solar System
into interstellar space. Take
a look at those stars and you get
some idea."</p>

<p>Spencer Chambers stroked his
gray mustache, asked calmly:
"What do you figure our chances
are of getting back?"</p>

<p>"That's something we'll know
more about later," said Craven.
"Doesn't look too bright right
now. I'm not worrying about that.
What I'm wondering about is
what Manning and Page are going
to do now that they have us
out here."</p>

<p>"I thought you'd be," said a
voice that came out of clear air.</p>

<p>They stared at the place from
which the voice had seemed to
come. There was a slight refraction
in the air; then, swiftly, a
man took shape. It was Manning.
He stood before them, smiling.</p>

<p>"Hello, Manning," said Craven.
"I figured you'd pay us a call
when you got around to it."</p>

<p>"Look here," snarled Stutsman,
but he stopped when Chambers'
hand fell upon his shoulder,
gripped it hard.</p>

<p>"Got plenty of air?" asked
Greg.</p>

<p>"Air? Sure. Atmosphere machines
working perfectly," Craven
replied.</p>

<p>"Fine," said Greg. "How about
food and water? Plenty of both?"</p>

<p>"Plenty," said Craven.</p>

<p>"Look here, Manning," broke in
Chambers, "where's all this questioning
leading? What have you
got up your sleeve?"</p>

<p>"Just wanted to be sure," Greg
told him. "Would hate to have
you fellows starve on me, or go
thirsty. Wouldn't want to come
back and find you all dead."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come back?" asked Chambers
wonderingly. "I'm afraid I don't
understand. Is this a joke of
some sort?"</p>

<p>"No joke," said Greg grimly.
"I thought you might have
guessed. I'm going to leave you
here."</p>

<p>"Leave us here?" roared Stutsman.</p>

<p>"Keep your shirt on," snapped
Greg. "Just for a while, until we
can go back to the Solar System
and finish a little job we're doing.
Then we'll come back and get
you."</p>

<p>Craven grimaced. "I thought it
would be something like that."
He squinted at Manning through
the thick lenses. "You never miss
a bet, do you?"</p>

<p>Greg laughed. "I try not to."</p>

<p>A little silence fell upon the
three men and Manning's image.</p>

<p>Greg broke it. "How about
your energy collector?" he asked
Craven. "Will it maintain the
ship out here? You get cosmic
rays. Not too much else, I'm
afraid."</p>

<p>Craven grinned wryly. "You're
right, but we can get along. The
accumulators are practically
drained, though, and we won't be
able to store anything. Would
you mind shooting us over just
a little power? Enough to charge
the accumulators a little for
emergency use."</p>

<p>He looked over his shoulder,
almost apprehensively.</p>

<p>"There might be an emergency
out here, you know. Nobody
knows anything about this place."</p>

<p>"I'll give you a little power,"
Greg agreed.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said
Craven, half in mockery. "No
doubt you think yourself quite
smart, Manning, getting us out
here. You know you have us
stranded, that we can't collect
more than enough power to live
on."</p>

<p>"That's why I did it," Greg
said, and vanished.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER NINETEEN</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Craven</span> watched the <i>Invincible</i>
gather speed and tear
swiftly through the black, saw
it grow tiny and then disappear
entirely, either swallowed by the
distance or snapping into the
strange super-space that existed
beyond the speed of light.</p>

<p>He turned from the window,
chuckling.</p>

<p>Stutsman snarled at him:
"What's so funny?"</p>

<p>The scientist glared at the
wolfish face and without speaking,
walked to the desk and sat
down. He reached for pencil and
paper.</p>

<p>Chambers walked over to
watch him.</p>

<p>"You've found something, Doctor,"
he said quietly.</p>

<p>Craven laughed, throatily.
"Yes, I have. I've found a lot.
Manning thinks he can keep us
out here, but he's wrong. We'll
be in the Solar System less than
a week after he gets there."</p>

<p>Chambers stifled a gasp, tried
to speak calmly. "You mean
this?"</p>

<p>"Of course I mean it. I don't
waste my time with foolish jokes."</p>

<p>"You have the secret of material
energy?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not that," the scientist
growled, "but I have something
else as valuable. I have the secret
of Manning's drive: I know
what it is that enables him to
exceed the speed of light ... to
go ten thousand times as fast as
light ... the Lord knows how
much faster if he wanted to."</p>

<p>"No ordinary drive would do
that," said Chambers. "It would
take more than power to make
a ship go that fast."</p>

<p>"You bet your life it would, and
Manning is the boy who's got it.
He uses a space field. I think I
can duplicate it."</p>

<p>"And how long will it take you
to do this work?"</p>

<p>"About a week," Craven told
him. "Perhaps a little longer, perhaps
a little less. But once we
go, we'll go as fast as Manning
does. We'll be short on power,
but I think I can do something
about that, too."</p>

<p>Chambers took a chair beside
the desk. "But do we know the
way home?"</p>

<p>"We can find it," said Craven.</p>

<p>"But there are no familiar constellations,"
objected Chambers.
"He dragged us out so far that
there isn't a single star that any
one of us can identify."</p>

<p>"I said I'd find the Solar System,"
Craven declared impatiently,
"and I will. Manning started
out for it, didn't he? I saw the
way he went. The Sun is a type
G star and all I'll do is look for
a type G star."</p>

<p>"But there may be more than
one type G star," objected the
financier.</p>

<p>"Probably are," Craven agreed,
"but there are other ways of
finding the Sun and identifying
it."</p>

<p>He volunteered no further information,
went back to work
with the pad and pencil. Chambers
rose wearily from his chair.</p>

<p>"Tell me when you know what
we can do," he said.</p>

<p>"Sure," Craven grunted.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"That's</span> the Sun," said Craven.
"That faint star between
those two brighter ones."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of it?" demanded
Stutsman.</p>

<p>"Of course. I don't make blunders."</p>

<p>"It's the only type G star in
that direction," suggested Chambers,
helpfully.</p>

<p>"Not that, either," declared
Craven. "In fact, there are several
type G stars. I examined them
all and I know I'm right."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" challenged
Stutsman.</p>

<p>"Spectroscopic examination.
That collector field of ours
gathers energy just like a burning
glass. You've seen a burning
glass, haven't you?"</p>

<p>He stared at Stutsman, directing
the question at him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Stutsman shuffled awkwardly,
unhappily.</p>

<p>"Well," Craven went on, "I
used that for a telescope. Gathered
the light from the suns and
analyzed it. Of course it didn't
act like a real telescope, produce
an image or anything like that,
but it was ideal for spectroscopic
work."</p>

<p>They waited for him to explain.
Finally, he continued:</p>

<p>"All of the stars I examined
were just type G stars, nothing
else, but there was a difference
in one of them. First, the spectroscope
showed lines of reflected
light passing through oxygen and
hydrogen, water vapor and carbon
dioxide. Pure planetary phenomena,
never found on a star
itself. Also it showed that a certain
per cent of the light was
polarized. Now remember that I
examined it for a long time and
I found out something else from
the length of observation which
convinces me. The light varied
with a periodic irregularity. The
chronometers aren't working exactly
right out here, so I can't
give you any explanation in terms
of hours. But I find a number of
regularly recurring changes in
light intensity and character ...
and that proves the presence of
a number of planetary bodies
circling the star. That's the only
way one could explain the fluctuations
for the G-type star is a
steady type. It doesn't vary
greatly and has no light fluctuations
to speak of. Not like the
Cepheid and Mira types."</p>

<p>"And that proves it's our Sun?"
asked Chambers.</p>

<p>Craven nodded. "Fairly definitely,
I'd say."</p>

<p>"How far away is it?" Stutsman
wanted to know.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Craven</span> snorted. "You would
ask something like that."</p>

<p>"But," declared Stutsman,
"there are ways of measuring
how far a star is away from any
point, measuring both the distance
and the size of the star."</p>

<p>"Okay," agreed Craven, "you
find me something solid and
within reach that's measurable.
Something, preferably, about 200
million miles or so across. Then
I'll tell you how far we are from
the Sun. This ship is not in an
orbit. It's not fixed in space. I
have no accurate way of measuring
distances and angles simultaneously
and accurately. Especially
angles as small as these
would be."</p>

<p>Craven and Stutsman glared
at one another.</p>

<p>"It's a long way however you
look at it," the financier said. "If
we're going to get there, we'll
have to start as soon as possible.
How soon can we start, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"Very soon. I have the gravity
concentration field developed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Manning left me just enough
power to get a good start." He
chuckled, took off his glasses,
wiped the lenses and put them
back on again. "Imagine him giving
me that power!"</p>

<p>"But after we use up that power,
what are we going to do?" demanded
Chambers. "This collector
lens of yours won't furnish us
enough to keep going."</p>

<p>"You're right," Craven conceded,
"but we'll be able to get
more. We'll build up what speed
we can and then we'll shut off
the drive and let momentum
carry us along. In the meantime
our collector will gather power
for us. We're advancing toward
the source of radiation now, instead
of away from it. Out here,
where there's little gravity stress,
fewer conflicting lines of gravitation,
we'll be able to spread out
the field, widen it, make it thousands
of miles across. And the
new photo-cells will be a help
as well."</p>

<p>"How are the photo-cells coming?"
asked Chambers.</p>

<p>Craven grinned. "We'll have a
bank of them in within a few
hours, and replace the others as
fast as we can. I have practically
the whole crew at work on them.
Manning doesn't know it, but he
found the limit of those photo-cells
when he was heaving energy
at us back in the Solar System.
He blistered them. I
wouldn't have thought it possible,
but it was. You have to hand it
to Manning and Page. They are
a couple of smart men."</p>

<p>To the eye there was only one
slight difference between the old
cells and the new ones. The new
type cell, when on no load, appeared
milky white, whereas the
old cells on no load were silvery.
The granular surface of the new
units was responsible for the difference
in appearance, for each
minute section of the surface was
covered with even more minute
metallic hexagonal pyramids and
prisms.</p>

<p>"Just a little matter of variation
in the alloy," Craven explained.
"Crystalization of the alloy,
forming those little prisms
and pyramids. As a result, you
get a surface thousands of times
greater than in the old type.
Helps you absorb every bit of
the energy."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> <i>Interplanetarian</i> arrowed
swiftly starward, driving
ahead with terrific momentum
while the collector lens, sweeping
up the oncoming radiations,
charged the great banks of accumulators.
The G-type star toward
which they were heading
was still pale, but the two brighter
stars to either side blazed like
fiery jewels against the black of
space.</p>

<p>"You say we'll be only a week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
or so behind Manning?" asked
Chambers.</p>

<p>Craven looked at the financier,
his eyes narrowed behind the
heavy lenses. He sucked in his
loose lips and turned once again
to the control board.</p>

<p>"Perhaps a little longer," he
admitted finally. "We're losing
time, having to go along on momentum
in order to collect power.
But the nearer we get to
those stars, the more power we'll
have and we'll be able to move
faster."</p>

<p>Chambers drummed idly on
the arm of his chair, thinking.</p>

<p>"Perhaps there's time yet," he
said, half to himself. "With the
power we'll have within the
Solar System, we can stop Manning
and the revolution. We can
gain control again."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Craven</span> was silent, watching
the dials.</p>

<p>"Manning might even pass us
on the way back to look for us,"
Chambers went on. "He thinks
we're still out there. He wouldn't
expect to find us where we are,
light years from where we
started."</p>

<p>Craven shot him a curious
look. "I wouldn't be too sure of
that. Manning has a string of
some sort tied to us. He's got us
tagged ... good and proper. He's
always been able to find us again,
no matter where we were. I have
a hunch he'll find us again, even
way out here."</p>

<p>Chambers shrugged his shoulders.
"It really doesn't matter.
Just so we get close enough to
the Sun so we can load those accumulators
and jam the photo-cells
full. With a load like that
we can beat him hands down."</p>

<p>The financier fell into a silence.
He stared out of the vision
plate, watching the stars. Still far
away, but so much nearer than
they had been.</p>

<p>His brain hummed with
dreams. Old dreams, revived
again, old dreams of conquest
and of empire, dreams of a power
that held a solar system in its
grip.</p>

<p>Craven broke his chain of
thoughts. "Where's our friend
Stutsman? I haven't seen him
around lately."</p>

<p>Chambers chuckled good-naturedly.
"He's sulking. He
seems to have gotten the idea
neither one of us likes him. He's
been spending most of his time
back in the engine room with
the crew."</p>

<p>"Were you talking about me?"
asked a silky voice.</p>

<p>They spun around to see
Stutsman standing in the doorway
of the control room. His face
was twisted into a wolfish grin
and in his right hand he held a
heat gun.</p>

<p>Chambers' voice was sharp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
like the note of a clanging bell.
"What's this?"</p>

<p>Stutsman's face twisted into an
even more exaggerated grin.
"This," he said, "is mutiny. I'm
taking over!" He laughed at them.</p>

<p>"No use calling the crew.
They're with me."</p>

<p>"Damn you!" shouted Chambers,
taking a step forward. He
halted as Stutsman jerked the
pistol up.</p>

<p>"Forget it, Chambers. You're
just second man from now on.
Maybe not even second man.
You tried out this dictator business
and you bungled it. You
went soft. You're taking orders
from me from now on. No questions,
no back talk. You do as I
say and maybe you won't get
hurt."</p>

<p>"You're mad, Stutsman!" cried
Chambers. "You can't get away
with this."</p>

<p>Stutsman barked out a brittle
laugh. "Who is going to stop me?"</p>

<p>"The people," Chambers shouted
at him. "The people will.
They won't allow this. When you
get back to the Solar System ..."</p>

<p>Stutsman growled, stepping toward
Chambers, pistol leveled.
"The people won't have anything
to say about this. I'll rule the
Solar System the way I want to.
There won't be anyone else
who'll have a thing to say about
it. So you dreamed of empire,
did you? You dreamed of a solar
dictatorship. Well, watch me!
I'll build a real empire. But I'll
be the head of it ... not you."</p>

<p>Craven sat down in his chair,
crossed his knees. "Just what do
you plan to do, Dictator Stutsman?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Stutsman</span> fairly foamed at
the mouth over the insolence
of Craven's voice. "I'll smash Manning
first. I'll wipe him out. This
ship will do it. You said yourself
it would. You have ten times the
power he has. And then ..."</p>

<p>Craven raised a hand and
waved him into silence. "So you
plan to reach the Solar System,
do you? You plan to meet Manning,
and destroy his ship. Nice
plan."</p>

<p>"What's wrong with it?" challenged
Stutsman.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Craven calmly.
"Absolutely nothing at all ... <i>except
that we may never reach
the Solar System</i>!"</p>

<p>Stutsman seemed to sag. The
wolfish snarl on his lips drooped.
His eyes stared. Then with an
effort he braced himself.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Why
can't we?" He gestured toward
the vision plate, toward the tiny
yellow star between the two
brighter stars.</p>

<p>"That," said Craven, "isn't our
Sun. It has planets, but it isn't
our Sun."</p>

<p>Chambers stepped quickly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Craven, reached out a hand and
hoisted him from the chair, shook
him.</p>

<p>"You must be joking! That
has to be the Sun!"</p>

<p>Craven shrugged free of Chambers'
clutch, spoke in an even
voice. "I never joke. We made a
mistake, that's all. I hadn't meant
to tell you yet. I had intended to
get in close to the star and take
on a full load of power and then
try to locate our Sun. But I'm
afraid it's a hopeless task."</p>

<p>"A hopeless task?" shrieked
Stutsman. "You are trying to
trick me. This is put up between
the two of you. That's the Sun
over there. I know it is!"</p>

<p>"It isn't," said Craven. "Manning
tricked us. He started off
in the wrong direction. He made
us think he was going straight
back to the Solar System, but he
didn't. He circled and went in
some other direction."</p>

<p>The scientist eyed Stutsman
calmly. Stutsman's knuckles
were white with the grip he had
upon the gun.</p>

<p>"We're lost," Craven told him,
looking squarely at him. "We
may never find the Solar System!"</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER TWENTY</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> revolution was over. Interplanetary
officials and
army heads had fled to the sanctuary
of Earth. Interplanetary
was ended ... ended forever, for
on every world, including Earth,
material energy engines were
humming. The people had power
to burn, to throw away, power
so cheap that it was practically
worthless as a commodity, but
invaluable as a way to a new
life, a greater life, a fuller life ...
a broader destiny for the human
race.</p>

<p>Interplanetary stocks were
worthless. The mighty power
plants on Venus and Mercury
were idle. The only remaining
tangible asset were the fleets of
spaceships used less than a
month before to ship the accumulators
to the outer worlds, to
bring them Sunward for recharging.</p>

<p>Patents protecting the rights
to the material energy engines
had been obtained from every
government throughout the Solar
System. New governments were
being formed on the wreckage of
the old. John Moore Mallory already
had been inaugurated as
president of the Jovian confederacy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
The elections on Mars and
Venus would be held within a
week.</p>

<p>Mercury, its usefulness gone
with the smashing of the accumulator
trade, had been abandoned.
No human foot now trod its surface.
Its mighty domes were empty.
It went its way, as it had gone
for billions of years, a little
burned out, worthless planet, ignored
and shunned. For a brief
moment it had known the conquering
tread of mankind, had
played its part in the commerce
of the worlds, but now it had reverted
to its former state ... a
lonely wanderer of the regions
near the Sun, a pariah among
the other planets.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Russell Page</span> looked across
the desk at Gregory Manning.
He heaved a sigh and dug
the pipe out of his jacket pocket.</p>

<p>"It's finished, Greg," he said.</p>

<p>Greg nodded solemnly, watching
Russ fill the bowl and apply
the match.</p>

<p>Except for the small crew,
they were alone in the <i>Invincible</i>.
John Moore Mallory and the
others were on their own worlds,
forming their own governments,
carrying out the dictates of the
people, men who would go down
in solar history.</p>

<p>The <i>Invincible</i> hung just off
Callisto. Russ looked out at the
mighty moon, saw the lonely
stretches of its ice-bound surface,
saw the silvery spot that was the
dome of Ranthoor.</p>

<p>"All done," said Greg, "except
for one thing."</p>

<p>"Go out and get Chambers and
the others," said Russ, puffing at
the pipe.</p>

<p>Greg nodded. "We may as well
get started."</p>

<p>Russ rose slowly, went to the
wall cabinet and lifted out a box,
the mechanical shadow with its
tiny space field surrounding the
fleck of steel that would lead
them to the <i>Interplanetarian</i>.
Carefully he lifted the machine
from its resting place and set it
on the desk. Bending over it, he
watched the dials.</p>

<p>Suddenly he whistled. "Greg,
they've moved! They aren't
where we left them!"</p>

<p>Greg sprang to his side and
stared at the readings. "They're
moving farther away from us ...
out into space. Where can they
be going?"</p>

<p>Russ straightened, scowling,
pulling at the pipe. "They probably
found another G-type star,
and are heading for that. They
must think it is old Sol."</p>

<p>"That sounds like it," said
Greg. "We spun all over the map
to throw Craven off and looped
several times so he'd lose all
sense of direction. Naturally he
would be lost."</p>

<p>"But he's evidently got something,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Russ pointed out. "We
left him marooned ... dead center,
out where he didn't have too
much radiation and couldn't get
leverage on any single body. Yet
he's moving&mdash;and getting farther
away all the time."</p>

<p>"He solved our gravitation concentration
screen," said Greg. "He
tricked us into giving him power
to build it."</p>

<p>The two men looked at one
another for a long minute.</p>

<p>"Well," said Russ, "that's that.
Craven and Chambers and Stutsman.
The three villains. All lost
in space. Heading for the wrong
star. Hopelessly lost. Maybe
they'll never find their way back."</p>

<p>He stopped and relit his pipe.
An aching silence fell in the
room.</p>

<p>"Poetic justice," said Russ.
"Hail and farewell."</p>

<p>Greg rubbed his fist indecisively
along the desk. "I can't do it,
Russ. We took them out there.
We marooned them. We have to
get them back or I couldn't sleep
nights."</p>

<p>Russ laughed quietly, watching
the bleak face that stared at
him. "I knew that's what you'd
say."</p>

<p>He knocked out the pipe,
crushed a fleck of burning tobacco
with his boot. Pocketing the
pipe, he walked to the control
panel, sat down and reached for
the lever. The engines hummed
louder and louder. The <i>Invincible</i>
darted spaceward.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"It's</span> too late now," said Chambers.
"By the time we reach
that planetary system and charge
our accumulators, Manning and
Page will have everything under
control back in the Solar System.
Even if we could locate the star
that was our Sun, we wouldn't
have a chance to get there in
time."</p>

<p>"Too bad," Craven said, and
wagged his head, looking like a
solemn owl. "Too bad. Dictator
Stutsman won't have a chance to
strut his stuff."</p>

<p>Stutsman started to say something
and thought better of it. He
leaned back in his chair. From
his belt hung a heat pistol.</p>

<p>Chambers eyed the pistol with
ill-concealed disgust. "There's no
point in playing soldier. We
aren't going to try to upset your
mutiny. So far your taking over
the ship hasn't made any difference
to us ... so why should we
fight you?"</p>

<p>"It isn't going to make any
difference either," said Craven.
"Because there are just two
things that will happen to us.
We're either lost forever, will
never find our way back, will
spend the rest of our days wandering
from star to star, or Manning
will come out and take us by
the ear and lead us home again."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Chambers started, leaned forward
and fastened his steely eyes
on Craven. "Do you really think
he could find us?"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it," Craven
replied. "I don't know how
he does it, but I'm convinced he
can. Probably, however, he'll find
that we are lost and get rid of
us that way."</p>

<p>"No," said Chambers, "you're
wrong there. Manning wouldn't
do that. He'll come to get us."</p>

<p>"I don't know why he should,"
snapped Craven.</p>

<p>"Because he's that sort of man,"
declared Chambers.</p>

<p>"What you going to do when
he does get out here?" demanded
Stutsman. "Fall on his neck and
kiss him?"</p>

<p>Chambers smiled, stroked his
mustache. "Why, no," he said. "I
imagine we'll fight. We'll give
him everything we've got and
he'll do the same. It wouldn't
seem natural if we didn't."</p>

<p>"You're damned right we will,"
growled Stutsman. "Because I'm
running this show. You seem to
keep forgetting that. We have
power enough, when we get
those accumulators filled, to wipe
him out. And that is exactly what
I'm going to do."</p>

<p>"Fine," said Craven, mockingly,
"just fine. There's just one thing
you forget. Manning is the only
man who can lead us back to the
Solar System."</p>

<p>"Hell," stormed Stutsman,
"that doesn't make any difference.
I'll find my way back there
some way."</p>

<p>"You're afraid of Manning,"
Chambers challenged.</p>

<p>Stutsman's hand went down to
the heat pistol's grip. His eyes
glazed and his face twisted itself
into utter hatred. "I don't know
why I keep on letting you live.
Craven is valuable to me. I can't
kill him. But you aren't. You
aren't worth a damn to anyone."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Chambers</span> matched his stare.
Stutsman's hand dropped
from the pistol and he slouched to
his feet, walked from the room.</p>

<p>Afraid of Manning! He laughed,
a hollow, gurgling laugh. Afraid
of Manning!</p>

<p>But he was.</p>

<p>Within his brain hammered a
single sentence. Words he had
heard Manning speak as he
watched over the television set
at Manning's mocking invitation.
Words that beat into his brain
and seared his reason and made
his soul shrivel and grow small.</p>

<p>Manning talking to Scorio.
Talking to him matter-of-factly,
but grimly: "<i>I promise you that
we'll take care of Stutsman!</i>"</p>

<p>Manning had taken Scorio and
his gangsters one by one and sent
them to far corners of the Solar
System. One out to the dreaded
Vulcan Fleet, one to the Outpost,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
one to the Titan prison, and one
to the hell-hole on Vesta, while
Scorio had gone to a little mountain
set in a Venus swamp. They
hadn't a chance. They had been
locked within a force shell and
shunted through millions of miles
of space. No trial, no hearing ...
nothing. Just terrible, unrelenting
judgment.</p>

<p>"<i>I promise you that we'll take
care of Stutsman!</i>"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Craven's</span> only a few billion
miles ahead now," said
Gregory Manning. "With our
margin of speed, we should overhaul
him in a few more hours.
He is still short on power, but
he's remedying that rapidly. He's
getting nearer to that sun every
minute. Running in toward it as
he is, he tends to sweep up outpouring
radiations. That helps
him collect a whole lot more
than he would under ordinary
circumstances."</p>

<p>Russ, sitting before the controls,
pipe clenched in his teeth,
watching the dials, nodded soberly.</p>

<p>"All I'm afraid of," he said, "is
that he'll get too close to that
sun before we catch up with him.
If he gets close enough so he can
fill those accumulators, he'll pack
a bigger wallop than we do. It'll
all be in one bolt, of course, for
his power isn't continuous like
ours. He has to collect it slowly.
But when he's really loaded, he
can give us aces and still win. I'd
hate to take everything he could
pack into those accumulators."</p>

<p>Greg shuddered. "So would I."</p>

<p>The <i>Invincible</i> was exceeding
the speed of light, was enveloped
in the mysterious darkness that
characterized the speed. They
could see nothing outside the
ship, for there was nothing to see.
But the tiny mechanical shadow,
occupying a place of honor on
the navigation board, kept them
informed of the position and the
distance of the <i>Interplanetarian</i>.</p>

<p>Greg lolled in his chair, watching
Russ.</p>

<p>"I don't think we need to worry
about him throwing the entire
load of the accumulators at us,"
he said. "He wouldn't dare load
those accumulators to peak capacity.
He's got to leave enough
carrying capacity in the cells to
handle any jolts we send him
and he knows we can send him
plenty. He has to keep that handling
margin at all times, over and
above what he takes in for power,
because his absorption screen is
also a defensive screen. And he
has to use some power to keep
our television apparatus out."</p>

<p>Russ chuckled. "I suppose, at
that, we have him plenty worried."</p>

<p>The thunder of the engines
filled the control room. For days
now that thunder had been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
their ears. They had grown accustomed
to it, now hardly noticed
it. Ten mighty engines,
driving the <i>Invincible</i> at a pace
no other ship had ever obtained,
except, possibly, the <i>Interplanetarian</i>,
although lack of power
should have held Craven's ship
down to a lower speed. Craven
wouldn't have dared to build up
the acceleration they had now
attained, for he would have
drained his banks and been unable
to charge them again.</p>

<p>"Maybe he won't fight," said
Russ. "Maybe he's figured out
by this time that he's heading for
the wrong star. He may be glad
to see us and follow us back to
the Solar System."</p>

<p>"No chance of that. Craven
and Chambers won't pass up a
chance for a fight. They'll give
us a few wallops if only for the
appearance of things."</p>

<p>"We're crawling up all the
time," said Russ. "If we can catch
him within four or five billion
miles of the star, he won't be too
tough to handle. Be getting
plenty of radiations even then,
but not quite as much as he
would like to have."</p>

<p>"He'll have to start decelerating
pretty soon," Greg declared.
"He can't run the chance of
smashing into the planetary system
at the speed he's going. He
won't want to waste too much
power using his field as a brake,
because he must know by this
time that we're after him and
he'll want what power he has to
throw at us."</p>

<p>Hours passed. The <i>Invincible</i>
crept nearer and nearer, suddenly
seemed to leap ahead as the
<i>Interplanetarian</i> began deceleration.</p>

<p>"Keep giving her all you got,"
Greg urged Russ. "We've got
plenty of power for braking. We
can overhaul him and stop in a
fraction of the time he does."</p>

<p>Russ nodded grimly. The distance
indicator needle on the
mechanical shadow slipped off
rapidly. Greg, leaping from his
chair, hung over it, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, "we better
slow down now. If we don't, we'll
be inside the planetary system."</p>

<p>"How far out is Craven?"
asked Russ.</p>

<p>"Not far enough," Greg replied
unhappily. "He can't be more
than three billion miles from the
star and that star's hot. A class
G, all right, but a good deal
younger than old Sol."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"We'll</span> let them know we've
arrived," grinned Greg.
He sent a stabbing beam of half
a billion horsepower slashing at
the <i>Interplanetarian</i>.</p>

<p>The other ship staggered but
steadied itself.</p>

<p>"They know," said Russ cryptically
from his position in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of the vision plate. "We shook
them up a bit."</p>

<p>They waited. Nothing happened.</p>

<p>Greg scratched his head.
"Maybe you were right. Maybe
they don't want to fight."</p>

<p>Together they watched the
<i>Interplanetarian</i>. It was still moving
in toward the distant sun, as
if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>"We'll see," said Greg.</p>

<p>Back at the controls he threw
out a gigantic tractor beam,
catching the other ship in a net
of forces that visibly cut its
speed.</p>

<p>Space suddenly vomited lashing
flame that slapped back and
licked and crawled in living
streamers over the surface of the
<i>Invincible</i>. The engines moaned
in their valiant battle to keep up
the outer screen. The pungent
odor of ozone filtered into the
control room. The whole ship
was bucking and vibrating, creaking,
as if it were being pulled
apart.</p>

<p>"So they don't want to fight,
eh?" hooted Russ.</p>

<p>Greg gritted his teeth. "They
snapped the tractor beam."</p>

<p>"They have power there," Russ
declared.</p>

<p>"Too much," said Greg. "More
power than they have any right
to have."</p>

<p>His hand went out to the lever
on the board and pulled it back.
A beam smashed out, with the
engines' screaming drive behind
it, billions of horsepower driving
with unleashed ferocity at the
other ship.</p>

<p>Greg's hand spun a dial, while
the generators roared thunderous
defiance.</p>

<p>"I'm giving them the radiation
scale," said Greg.</p>

<p>The <i>Interplanetarian</i> was staggering
under the terrific bombardment,
but its screen was handling
every ounce of the power
that Greg was pouring into it.</p>

<p>"Their photo-cells can't handle
that," cried Russ. "No photo-cell
would handle all that stuff you're
shooting at them. Unless ..."</p>

<p>"Unless what?"</p>

<p>"Unless Craven has improved
on them."</p>

<p>"We'll have to find out. Get
the televisor."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Russ</span> leaped for the television
machine.</p>

<p>A moment later he lifted a
haggard face.</p>

<p>"I can't get through," he said.
"Craven's got our beams stopped
and now he has our television
blocked out."</p>

<p>Greg nodded. "We might have
expected that. When he could
scramble our televisors back in
the Jovian worlds, he certainly
ought to be able to screen his
ship against them."</p>

<p>He shoved the lever clear over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
slamming the extreme limit of
power into the beam. The engines
screamed like demented
things, howling and shrieking. Instantly
a tremendous sheet of solid
flame spun a fiery web around
the <i>Interplanetarian</i>, turning it
into a blazing inferno of lapping,
leaping fire.</p>

<p>A dozen terrific beams, billions
of horsepower in each, stabbed
back at the <i>Invincible</i> as the
<i>Interplanetarian</i> shunted the terrific
energy influx from the overcharged
accumulators to the various
automatic energy discharges.</p>

<p>The <i>Invincible's</i> screen flared
in defense and the ten great engines
wailed in utter agony. More
stabbing flame shot from the
<i>Interplanetarian</i> in slow explosions.</p>

<p>The temperature in the <i>Invincible's</i>
control room was rising.
The ozone was sharp enough to
make their eyes water and nostrils
burn. The vision glass was
blanked out by the lapping
flames that crawled and writhed
over the screen outside the glass.</p>

<p>Russ tore his collar open,
wiped his face with his shirt
sleeve. "Try a pure magnetic!"</p>

<p>Greg, his face set and bleak as
a wall of stone, grunted agreement.
His fingers danced over the
control manual.</p>

<p>Suddenly the stars outside
twisted and danced, like stars
gone mad, as if they were dancing
a riotous jig in space, some
uproariously hopping up and
down while others were applauding
the show that was being provided
for their unblinking eyes.</p>

<p>The magnetic field was tightening
now, twisting the light from
those distant stars and bending
it straight again. The <i>Interplanetarian</i>
reeled like a drunken
thing and the great arcs of electric
flame looped madly and
plunged straight for the field's
very heart.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> stars danced weirdly in
far-off space again as the <i>Interplanetarian's</i>
accumulators lashed
out with tremendous force to oppose
the energy of the field.</p>

<p>The field glowed softly and
disappeared.</p>

<p>"They have us stopped at
every turn," groaned Russ. "There
must be some way, something
we can do." He looked at Greg.
Greg grinned without humor,
wiping his face. "There is something
we can do," said Russ
grimly. "We should have thought
of it long ago."</p>

<p>He strode to the desk, reached
out one hand and drew a calculator
near.</p>

<p>"You keep them busy," he
snapped. "I'll have this thing
figured out in just a while."</p>

<p>From the engine rooms came
the roar and hum of the laboring
units and the <i>Invincible</i> shuddered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
once again as Greg grimly
hurled one beam after another,
at the <i>Interplanetarian</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Interplanetarian</i> struck
back, using radio frequency that
flamed fiercely against the <i>Invincible's</i>
outer screen. Simultaneously
the <i>Interplanetarian</i> leaped
forward with a sudden surge of
accumulated energy, driving at
the star that lay not more than
three billion miles away.</p>

<p>Greg worked desperately, cursing
under his breath. He pulled
down the outer screen that was
fighting directly against the radio
frequency, energy for energy,
and allowed the beam to strike
squarely on the second screen,
the inversion field that shunted
the major portion of the energy
impacting against it through 90
degrees into another space.</p>

<p>The engines moaned softly
and settled into a quieter rumble
as the necessity of supplying the
first screen was eliminated. But
they screamed once again as
Greg sent out a tractor beam
that seized and held, dragged the
<i>Interplanetarian</i> to a standstill.
Craven's ship had gained millions
of miles, though, and established
a tremendous advantage by fighting
nearer to its source of energy.</p>

<p>"Russ," gasped Greg, "if you
don't get that scheme of yours
figured out pretty soon, we're
done for. They've stopped everything
we've got. They're nearer
the sun. We won't stand a chance
if they make another break like
that."</p>

<p>Russ glanced up to answer, but
his mouth fell open in amazement
and he did not speak. A
streak of terrible light was striking
at them from the <i>Interplanetarian</i>,
blinding white light, and
along that highway of light
swarmed a horde of little green
figures, like squirming green
amebas. Swarming toward the
<i>Invincible</i>, stretching out hungry,
pale-green pseudopods toward the
inversion barrier ... <i>and eating
through it</i>!</p>

<p>Wherever they touched, holes
appeared. They drifted through
the inversion screen easily and
began drilling into the inner
screen of anti-entropy. Eating
their way into the anti-entropy ...
<i>into a state of matter which
Russ and Greg had thought
would resist all change</i>!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">For</span> seconds both men stood
transfixed, unable to believe
the evidence of their eyes. But the
ameba things came on in ever-increasing
throngs, creatures that
gnawed and slobbered at the
anti-entropy, eating into it, flaking
it away, drilling their way
through it.</p>

<p>When they pierced the anti-entropy,
they would cut through
the steel plates of the <i>Invincible</i>
like so much paper!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>And more were coming. More
and more!</p>

<p>With a grunt of amazement,
Greg slammed a beam straight
into the heart of the amebas.
They ate the beam and vanished
as mistily as before, little glowing
things that ate and died. But
there were always more to take
their place. They overwhelmed
the beam and ate back along its
length, attacked the screen again.</p>

<p>They ate through walls of
force and walls of metal, and a
rush of hissing air began to flame
into ions in the terrific battle of
energies outside the <i>Invincible</i>.</p>

<p>Russ was crouching over the
manual of the televisor board.
His breath moaned in his throat
as his fingers flew.</p>

<p>"I have to have power, Greg,"
he said. "Lots of power."</p>

<p>"Take it." Greg replied. "I
haven't been able to do anything
with it. It isn't any use to me."</p>

<p>Russ's thumb reached out and
tripped the activating lever. The
giant engines shrieked and
yowled.</p>

<p>Something was happening on
the television screen ... something
terrifying. Craven's ship
seemed to retreat suddenly for
millions of miles ... and as suddenly
the <i>Invincible</i> appeared on
the screen. For a single flashing
instant, the view held; then it
was gone in blank grayness. For
seconds nothing happened on the
screen, unnerving seconds while
the two men held their breath.</p>

<p>The screen's grayness fled and
they looked into the control room
of the <i>Interplanetarian</i>. Craven
was hunched in a chair, intent
upon a series of controls. Behind
him and to one side stood Stutsman,
a heat pistol dangled from
his hand, his face twisted into a
sneer of triumph. There was no
sign of Chambers.</p>

<p>"You damn fool," Craven was
snapping at Stutsman. "You're
cheating us out of the only
chance we ever had of getting
home."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Shut</span> up," snarled Stutsman,
the pistol jerking in his
hand. "Have you got that apparatus
on full power?"</p>

<p>"It's been on full power for
minutes now," said Craven. "It
must be eating holes straight
through Manning's ship."</p>

<p>"See you keep it that way.
I really don't need you any more,
anyhow. I've watched and I
know all the tricks. I could carry
on this battle single-handed."</p>

<p>Craven did not reply, merely
hunched closer over the controls,
eyes watching flickering dials.</p>

<p>Greg jogged Russ's elbow.
"That must be the apparatus
over there, in the corner of the
room. That triangular affair. A
condenser of some sort. That
stuff they're throwing at us must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
be super-saturated force fields
and they'd need a space-field condenser
for that."</p>

<p>Russ nodded. "We'll take care
of that."</p>

<p>His fingers moved swiftly and
a transport beam whipped out,
riding the television beam. Bands
of force wrapped around the
triangular machine and wrenched
viciously. In the screen the apparatus
disappeared ... simply
was gone. It now lay within the
<i>Invincible's</i> control room, jerked
there by the tele-transport.</p>

<p>The flood of dazzling light
reaching out from the <i>Interplanetarian</i>
snapped off and the little
green ameba things were gone.
The shrill whistle of escaping air
stopped as the eaten screens
clamped down again, sealing in
the atmosphere despite the holes
bored through the metal plates.</p>

<p>In the television screen, Craven
leaped from his chair, was
staring with Stutsman at the
place where the concentrator
had stood. The machine had been
ripped from a welded base and
jagged, bright, torn metal gleamed
in the control room lights.
Snapped cables and broken busbars
lay piled about the room.</p>

<p>"What happened?" Stutsman
was screaming. They heard Craven
laugh at the terror in the
other's voice. "Manning just
walked in and grabbed it away
from us."</p>

<p>"But he couldn't! We had the
screen up! He couldn't get
through!"</p>

<p>Craven shrugged his shoulders.
"I don't know how he did it, but
he did. Probably he could clean
out the whole place if he wanted
to."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," said Russ,
judiciously.</p>

<p>He stripped bank after bank
of the other ship's photo-cells
from their moorings, wrecked the
force field controls, ripped cables
from the engines and left the
ship without means of collecting
power, without means of using
power, without means of movement,
of offense or defense.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> leaned back in his chair and
regarded the screen with
deep satisfaction.</p>

<p>"That," he decided, "should
hold them for a while."</p>

<p>He hauled the pipe out of his
pocket and filled it from the battered
leather pouch.</p>

<p>Greg regarded him with a
quizzical stare. "You sent the
televisor back in time. You got
it inside the <i>Interplanetarian</i> before
Craven had run up his
screen and then you brought it
forward."</p>

<p>"You guessed it," said Russ,
tamping the tobacco into the
bowl. "We should have thought
of that long ago. We have a time
factor there. In fact, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
thing revolves around time. We
move the televisor, we use the
tele-transport, by giving the objects
we wish to move an acceleration
in time."</p>

<p>Greg wrinkled his brow. "Maybe
that means we can really investigate
the past, or even the
future. Can sit here before our
screen and see everything that
has happened, everything that is
going to happen."</p>

<p>Russ shook his head. "I don't
know, Greg. Notice, though, that
we got no screen response until
the televisor came up out of the
past and actually reached the
point which coincided with the
present. That is, the screen and
the televisor itself have to be on
the same time level for them to
operate. We might modify the
screen, even modify the televisor
so that we could travel in time,
but it will take a lot of research,
a lot of work. And especially it
will take a whale of a lot of
power."</p>

<p>"We have the power," said
Greg.</p>

<p>Russ moved the lighter back
and forth over the tobacco, igniting
it carefully. Clouds of blue
smoke swirled around his head.
He spoke out of the smoke.</p>

<p>"Right now," he said, "we better
see how Craven and our other
friends are getting along. I didn't
like the way Stutsman was talking
or the way he was swinging
that gun around. And Chambers
wasn't anywhere in sight. There's
something screwy about the entire
thing."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"What</span> are we going to do
now?" demanded Stutsman.</p>

<p>Craven grinned at him. "That's
up to you. Remember, you're the
master mind around here. You
took over and said you were going
to run things." He waved a
casual hand at the shattered machines,
the ripped-out apparatus.
"Well, there you are. Go ahead
and run the joint."</p>

<p>"But you will have to help,"
pleaded Stutsman, his face twisted
until it seemed that he was
suffering intense physical agony.
"You know what to do. I don't."</p>

<p>Craven shook his head. "There
isn't any use starting. Manning
will be along almost anytime
now. We'll wait and see what he
has in mind."</p>

<p>"Manning!" shrieked Stutsman,
waving the pistol wildly. "Always
Manning. One would think you
were working for Manning."</p>

<p>"He's the big shot out in this
little corner of space right now,"
Craven pointed out. "There isn't
any way you can get around
that."</p>

<p>Stutsman backed carefully
away. His gun came up and he
looked at Craven appraisingly,
as if selecting his targets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Put down that gun," said a
voice.</p>

<p>Gregory Manning stood between
Stutsman and Craven.
There had been no foggy forerunner
of his appearance. He had
just snapped out of empty air.</p>

<p>Stutsman stared at him, his
eyes widening, but the gun remained
steady in his hand.</p>

<p>"Look out, Craven," warned
Greg. "He's going to fire and it
will go right through me and hit
you."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">There</span> was the thump of a
falling body as Craven hurled
himself out of his chair, hit the
floor and rolled. Stutsman's gun
vomited flame. The spouting
flame passed through Greg's
image, blasted against the chair
in which Craven had sat, fused
it until it fell in on itself.</p>

<p>"Russ," said Greg quietly, "disarm
this fellow before he hurts
somebody."</p>

<p>An unseen force reached out
and twisted the gun from Stutsman's
hand, flung it to one side.
Swiftly Stutsman's hands were
forced behind his back and held
there by invisible bonds.</p>

<p>Stutsman cried out, tried to
struggle, but he was unable to
move. It was as if giant hands
had gripped him, were holding
him in a viselike clutch.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Manning," said Craven,
getting up off the floor. "The
fool would have shot this time.
He's threatened it for days. He
has been developing a homicidal
mania."</p>

<p>"We don't need to worry about
him now," declared Greg. He
turned around to face Craven.
"Where's Chambers?"</p>

<p>"Stutsman locked him up,"
said Craven. "I imagine he has
the key in his pocket. Locked
him up in the stateroom. Chambers
jumped him and tried to
take the gun away from him and
Stutsman laid him out, hit him
over the head. He kept Chambers
locked up after that. Hasn't allowed
anyone to go near the
room. Hasn't even given him
food and water. That was three
days ago."</p>

<p>"Get the key out of his pocket,"
directed Greg. "Go and see how
Chambers is."</p>

<p>Alone in the control room with
Stutsman, Greg looked at him.</p>

<p>"I have a score to settle with
you, Stutsman," he said. "I had intended
to let it ride, but not now."</p>

<p>"You can't touch me," blustered
Stutsman. "You wouldn't
dare."</p>

<p>"What makes you think I
wouldn't?"</p>

<p>"You're bluffing. You've got a
lot of tricks, but you can't do
the things you would like me to
think you can. You've got Chambers
and Craven fooled, but not
me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"It may be that I can offer
you definite proof."</p>

<p>Chambers staggered over the
threshold. His clothing was rumpled.
A rude bandage was wound
around his head. His face was
haggard and his eyes red.</p>

<p>"Hello, Manning," he said. "I
suppose you've won. The Solar
System must be in your control
by now."</p>

<p>He lifted his hand to his mustache,
brushed it, a feeble attempt
at playing the old role he'd
acted so long.</p>

<p>"We've won," said Greg quietly,
"but you're wrong about our being
in control. The governments
are in the hands of the people,
where they should be."</p>

<p>Chambers nodded. "I see," he
mumbled. "Different people, different
ideas." His eyes rested on
Stutsman and Greg saw sudden
rage sweep across the gray, haggard
face. "So you've got him,
have you? What are you going to
do with him? What are you going
to do with all of us?"</p>

<p>"I haven't had time to think
about it," said Greg. "I've principally
been thinking about Stutsman here."</p>

<p>"He mutinied," rasped Chambers.
"He seized the ship, turned
the crew against me."</p>

<p>"And the penalty for that,"
said Greg, quietly, "is death.
Death by walking in space."</p>

<p>Stutsman writhed within the
bands of force that held him
tight. His face contorted. "No,
damn you! You can't do that!
Not to me, you can't!"</p>

<p>"Shut up," roared Chambers
and Stutsman quieted.</p>

<p>"I was thinking, too," said Greg,
"that at his order thousands of
people were mercilessly shot
down back in the Solar System.
Stood against a wall and mowed
down. Others were killed like
wild animals in the street. Thousands
of them."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> moved slowly toward Stutsman
and the man cringed.</p>

<p>"Stutsman," he said, "you're a
butcher. You're a stench in the
nostrils of humanity. You aren't
fit to live."</p>

<p>"Those," said Craven, "are my
sentiments exactly."</p>

<p>"You hate me," screamed
Stutsman. "All of you hate me.
You are doing this because you
hate me."</p>

<p>"Everyone hates you, Stutsman,"
said Greg. "Every living
person hates you. You have a
cloud of hate hanging over you
as black and wide as space."</p>

<p>The man closed his eyes, trying
to break free of the bonds.</p>

<p>"Bring me a spacesuit," snapped
Greg, watching Stutsman's face.</p>

<p>Craven brought it and dropped
it at Stutsman's feet.</p>

<p>"All right, Russ," said Greg.
"Turn him loose."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Stutsman swayed and almost
fell as the bands of force released
him.</p>

<p>"Get into that suit," ordered
Greg.</p>

<p>Stutsman hesitated, but something
he saw in Greg's face made
him lift the suit, step into it,
fasten it about his body.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do
with me?" he whimpered. "You
aren't going to take me back to
Earth again, are you? You aren't
going to make me stand trial?"</p>

<p>"No," said Greg, gravely, "we
aren't taking you back to Earth.
And you're standing trial right
now."</p>

<p>Stutsman read his fate in the
cold eyes that stared into his.
Chattering frightenedly, he
rushed at Greg, plunged through
him, collided with the wall of the
ship and toppled over, feebly attempting
to rise.</p>

<p>Invisible hands hoisted him to
his feet, gripped him, held him
upright. Greg walked toward him,
stood facing him.</p>

<p>"Stutsman," he said, "you have
four hours of air. That will give
you four hours to think, to make
your peace with death." He
turned toward the other two.
Chambers nodded grimly. Craven
said nothing.</p>

<p>"And now," said Greg to Craven,
"if you will fasten down his
helmet."</p>

<p>The helmet clanged shut, shutting
out the pleas and threats
that came from Stutsman's throat.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Stutsman</span> saw distant stars,
cruel, gleaming eyes that
glared at him. Empty space fell
away on all sides.</p>

<p>Numbed by fear, he realized
where he was. Manning had
picked him up and thrown him
far into space ... out into that
waste where for hundreds of light
years there was only the awful
nothingness of space.</p>

<p>He was less than a speck of
dust, in this great immensity of
emptiness. There was no up or
down, no means of orientation.</p>

<p>Loneliness and terror closed in
on him, a terrible agony of fear.
In four hours his air would be
gone and then he would die! His
body would swirl and eddy
through this great cosmic ocean.
It would never be found. It would
remain here, embalmed by the
cold of space, until the last clap
of eternity.</p>

<p>There was one way, the easy
way. His hand reached up and
grasped the connection between
his helmet and the air tank. One
wrench and he would die swiftly,
quickly ... instead of letting
death stalk him through the darkness
for the next four hours.</p>

<p>He shivered and his hand
loosened its hold, dropped away.
He was afraid to hasten death.
He wanted to put it off. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
afraid of death ... horribly afraid.</p>

<p>The stars mocked him and he
seemed to hear hooting laughter
from somewhere far away. Curiously,
it sounded like his own
laughter....</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"I'll</span> make it easy for you,
Manning," Chambers said.
"I know that all of us are guilty.
Guilty in the eyes of the people
and the law. Guilty in your eyes.
If we had won, there would have
been no penalty. There's never a
penalty for the one who wins."</p>

<p>"Penalty," said Greg, his eyes
half smiling. "Why, yes, I think
there is. I'm going to order you
aboard the <i>Invincible</i> for something
to eat and to get some rest."</p>

<p>"You mean to say that we
aren't prisoners?"</p>

<p>Greg shook his head. "Not
prisoners," he said. "Why, I came
out here to guide you back to
Earth. I hauled you out here
and got you into this jam. It was
up to me to get you out of it.
I would have done the same for
Stutsman, too, but ..."</p>

<p>He hesitated and looked at
Chambers.</p>

<p>Chambers stared back and
slowly nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, Manning," he said. "I
think I understand."</p>

<hr class="tb" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Chambers</span> lit his cigar and
leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>"I wish you could see it my
way, Manning," he said. "There's
no place for me on Earth, no
place for me in the Solar System.
You see, I tried and failed. I'm
just a has-been back there."</p>

<p>He laughed quietly. "Somehow,
I can't imagine myself coming
back in the role of the defeated
tribal leader, chained to your
chariot, so to speak."</p>

<p>"But it wouldn't be that way,"
protested Greg. "Your company
is gone, true, and your stocks are
worthless, but you haven't lost
everything. You still have a fleet
of ships. With our new power, the
Solar System will especially need
ships. Lots of ships. For the
spacelanes will be filled with
commerce. You'd be coming
back to a new deal, a new Solar
System, a place that has been
transformed almost overnight by
power that's practically free."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know all that,"
said Chambers. "But I climbed
too high. I got too big. I can't
come back now as something
small, a failure."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have things we need,"
said Greg. "The screen that blankets
out our television and tele-transport,
for example. We need
your screen as a safeguard against
the very thing we have created.
Think of what criminal uses
could be made of the tele-transport.
No vault, no net of charged
wires, nothing, could stop a thief
from taking anything he wanted.
Prisons would cease to be prisons.
Criminals could reach in and
pick up their friends, no matter
how many guards there were.
Prisons and bank vaults and
national treasuries could be
cleaned out in a single day."</p>

<p>"Then there's the super-saturated
space fields," added Russ,
ruefully. "Those almost got us.
If I hadn't thought of moving the
televisor through time, we would
have had to pull stakes and run
for it."</p>

<p>"No, you wouldn't," pointed
out Craven. "You could have
wiped us out in a moment. You
can disintegrate matter. Send it
up in a puff of smoke ... rip
every electron apart and send it
hurtling away."</p>

<p>"Of course we could have,
Craven," said Greg, "but we
wouldn't."</p>

<p>Chambers laughed softly. "Not
quite mad enough at us to do
that, eh?"</p>

<p>Greg looked at him. "I guess
that must have been it."</p>

<p>"But I'm curious about the
green space fields," persisted Russ.</p>

<p>"Simple," said Craven. "They
were just fields that had more
energy packed into a certain portion
of space than space could
take. Space fields that had far
more than their share of energy,
more than they could hold. A
super-saturated solution will
crystalize almost immediately onto
the tiniest crystal put into it.
Those fields acted the same way.
They crystalized instantly into
hyper-space the moment they
came into contact with other
energy, whether as photons of
radiation, matter or other space fields.
Your anti-entropy didn't
stand a chance under those conditions.
When they crystalized,
they took a chunk of the field
along with them, a small chunk,
but one after another they ate a
hole right through your screen."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Something</span> like that
would have a commercial
value," said Greg. "Useful in war,
too, and now that mankind has
taken to space, now that we're
spreading out, we must think of
possible attack. There must be
life on other planets throughout
the Galaxy. Someday they'll come.
If they don't, someday we'll go
to them. And we may need every
type of armament we can get
our hands on."</p>

<p>Chambers knocked the ash off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
his cigar and was staring out the
vision port. The ship had swung
so that through the port could
be seen the distant star toward
which the <i>Interplanetarian</i> had
been driving.</p>

<p>"For my part," said Chambers,
slowly, measuring each word,
"you can have those findings of
ours. We'll give them to you,
knowing you will use them as
they should be used. Craven can
tell you how they work. That is,
if Craven wants to. He is the
man who developed them."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Craven.
"They'll be something to remember
us by."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"But</span> you are coming back
with us, aren't you?" asked Greg.</p>

<p>Craven shook his head. "No,
I'm going with Chambers. I don't
know what he's thinking of, but
whatever it is, it's all right with
me. We've been together too
long. I'd miss someone to fight
with."</p>

<p>Chambers was still staring out
the vision port. He was talking,
but he did not seem to be talking
to them.</p>

<p>"I had a dream, you see. I saw
the people struggling against the
inefficiency and stupidity of popular
government. I saw the periodic
rise of bad leaders. I saw
them lead the people into blunders.
I read history and I saw
that since the time man had risen
from the ape, this had been going
on. So I proposed to give the
people scientific government ...
a business administration. An administration
that would have run
the government exactly as a successful
businessman runs his business.
The people would have resented
it if I had told them they
didn't know how to run their
affairs. There was only one way
to do it ... gain control and
force it down their throats."</p>

<p>Chambers was no longer a
beaten man, no longer a man
with a white bandage around his
head and his power stripped
from him. Once again he was the
fighting financier who had sat
back at the desk in the Interplanetary
building on Earth and
issued orders ... orders that sped
across millions of miles of space.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.
"They didn't want it. Man doesn't
want to live under scientific government.
He doesn't want to be
protected against blunders. He
wants what he calls freedom. The
right to do the things he wants
to do, even if it means making
a damn fool of himself. The right
to rise to great heights and tumble
to equally low depths. That's
human nature and I ruled it out.
But you can't rule out human
nature."</p>

<p>They sat in silence, no one
speaking. Russ cupped his pipe
bowl in his hand and watched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Chambers. Chambers leaned back
and slowly puffed at the cigar.
Greg just sat, his face unchanging.</p>

<p>Craven finally broke the silence.
"Just what are you planning
to do?"</p>

<p>Chambers flicked his hand toward
the distant sun that gleamed
through the vision port.</p>

<p>"There's a new solar system
out there," he said. "New worlds,
a new sun. A place to start over
again. You and I discovered it.
It's ours by right of discovery.
We'll go there and stake out our
claim."</p>

<p>"But there may be nothing
there," protested Greg. "That sun
is younger than our Sun. The
planets may not have cooled as
yet. Life may not have developed."</p>

<p>"In such a case," said Chambers,
"we shall find another
planetary system around another
sun. A system that has cooled,
where there is life."</p>

<p>Russ gasped. Here was something
important, something that
should set a precedent. The first
men to roam from star to star
seeking new worlds. The first
men to turn their backs on the
old solar system and strike out
in search of new worlds swinging
in their paths around distant
suns.</p>

<p>Greg was saying, "All right, if
that's the way you want it. I was
hoping you'd come back with us.
But we'll help you repair your
ship. We'll give you all the supplies
we can spare."</p>

<p>Russ rose to his feet. "That,"
he said, "calls for a little drink."</p>

<p>He opened a cabinet and took
out bottles and glasses.</p>

<p>"Only three," said Chambers.
"Craven doesn't drink."</p>

<p>Craven interrupted. "Pour one
for me, too, Page."</p>

<p>Chambers looked at the scientist,
astounded. "I never knew
you to take a drink in your life."</p>

<p>Craven twisted his face into a
grin. "This is a special occasion."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> <i>Invincible</i> was nearing
Mars, heading for Earth,
which was still a greenish sphere
far to one side of the flaming Sun.</p>

<p>Russ watched the little green
globe, thinking.</p>

<p>Earth was home. To him it always
would be home. But that
would be changed soon. Just a
few more generations, and, to
millions upon millions of human
beings, Earth no longer would be
home.</p>

<p>With the new material energy
engines, life on every planet
would be possible now, even easy.
The cost of manufacture, mining,
shipping across the vast distances
between the planets would be
only a fraction of what it had
been when man had been forced
to rely upon the unwieldy, expensive
accumulator system of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
supplying life-giving power.</p>

<p>Now Mars would have power
of her own. Even Pluto could
generate her own. And power
was ... well, it was power. The
power to live, the power to work,
to establish and maintain commerce,
to adjust gravity to Earth
standard or to any standard. The
power to remake and reshape
and rebuild planetary conditions
to suit man exactly.</p>

<p>Earthmen and Earthwomen
would be moving out en masse
now to the new and virgin fields
of endeavor&mdash;to the farms of
Venus, to the manufacturing
centers that were springing up
on Mars, to the mines of the
Jovian worlds, to the great laboratory
plants that would spring
up on Titan and on Pluto and
on the other colder worlds.</p>

<p>The migration of races had
started long ago. In the Old
Stone Age, the Cro-Magnon had
swept out of nowhere to oust the
Neanderthal. Centuries later the
barbarians of the north, in another
of those restless migrations,
had overwhelmed and swept
away the Roman Empire. And
many centuries later, migration
had turned from Europe to a
new world across the sea, and
fighting Americans had battled
their way from east to west, conquering
a continent.</p>

<p>And now another great migration
was on&mdash;man was leaving
the Earth, moving into space. He
was leaving behind him the
world that had reared and fostered him.
He was striking out
and out. First the planets would
be overrun, and then man would
leap from the planets to the
stars!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">For</span> years after America had
become a country, had built a
tradition of her own, Europe was
regarded by millions as the homeland.
But as the years swept by,
this had ceased to be and the
Americas were a world unto
themselves, owing nothing to
Europe.</p>

<p>And that was the way it would
be with Earth. For centuries, for
thousands of years, Earth would
be the Mother Planet, the homeland
for all the millions of roaming
men and women who dared
the gulfs of space and the
strangeness of new worlds. There
would be trips back to the Earth
for sentimental reasons ... to
see the place where one's ancestors
were born and had lived, to
goggle at the monument which
marked the point from which
the first spaceship had taken off
for the Moon, to visit old museums
and see old cities and breathe
the air that men and women had
breathed for thousands of years
before they found the power to
take them anywhere.</p>

<p>In the end, Earth would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
just a worn-out planet. Even now
her minerals were rapidly being
exhausted; her oil wells were dry
and all her coal was mined; her
industry stabilized and filled; her
businesses interlocking and highly
competitive. A world that was
too full, that had too many things,
too many activities, too many
people. A world that didn't need
men and women. A world where
even genius was kept from rising
to the top.</p>

<p>And this was what was driving
mankind away from the Earth.
The competition, the crowded
conditions, in business and industrial
fields, the lack of opportunity
for new development, the
everlasting struggle to get ahead,
fighting for a place to live when
millions of others were fighting
for the same thing. But not entirely
that, not that alone. There
was something else&mdash;that old adventuresome
spirit, the driving
urge to face new dangers, to step
over old frontiers, to do and dare,
to make a damn fool of one's self,
or to surpass the greatest accomplishments
of history.</p>

<p>But Earth would never die, for
there was a part of Earth in
every man and woman who
would go forth into space, part of
Earth's courage, part of Earth's
ideals, part of Earth's dreams.
The habits and the virtues and
the faults that Earth had spawned
and fostered ... these were things
that would never die. Old Earth
would live forever. Even when
she was drifting dust and the
Sun was a dead, cold star, Earth
would live on in the courage and
the dreams that by that time
would be spreading to the far
corners of the Galaxy.</p>

<p>Russ dug the pipe out of his
pocket, searched for the pouch,
found it on the desk behind him.
It was empty.</p>

<p>"Hell," he said, "my tobacco's
all gone."</p>

<p>Greg grinned. "You won't have
to wait long. We'll be back on
Earth in a few more hours."</p>

<p>Russ put the stem between his
teeth, bit down on it savagely.
"I guess that's right. I can dry
smoke her until we get there."</p>

<p>Earth was larger now. Mars
had swung astern.</p>

<p>Suddenly a winking light
stabbed out into space from the
night side of Earth. Signaling ...
signaling ... clearing the
spacelanes for a greater future
than any human prophet had
ever predicted.</p>
